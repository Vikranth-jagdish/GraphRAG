Table 13 mentions the 3 initial drugs and their 6 combinations, which can be prescribed. In general the therapy can be started at half the maximal dose-e.g. 5 mg of amlodipine, 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, and 5 mg of Enalapril or 50 mg of Losartan. On review after 2-4 weeks if BP control has not been achieved, then a second drug from one of the classes that has not been used (CCB, diuretic, ACE inhibitor, ARB), and the patient reviewed again for BP control. The doses of drugs to be used as initial or add-on therapy is mentioned in table 5

Certain combinations e.g. of CCB with ARBs/ACE inhibitors or diuretics with ARBs/ACE inhibitors are preferred, while combinations of ACE inhibitors with ARBs, and diuretics with beta-blockers are avoidable. The combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs has an increased risk of end-stage renal failure and stroke as documented in trial settings, (69) and is advised against by all guidelines. (18-21) The combination of thiazide and beta-blockers is also effective but since both these drugs can elevate blood glucose concentration, the combination should be used with caution in those with a higher risk of developing diabetes (obese, positive family history, glucose intolerance). (24, 68)

If the BP is not at goal even after optimal doses of 2 drugs and with regular adherence, then a 3 rd drug may be added. According to most guidelines the preferred 82Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

3 drug combination is of a calcium channel blocker along with ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. (CCB+ ACE Inhibitor +diuretic).

\*Angiotensin Receptor blockers (ARBs) can be used if there is intolerance to ACE inhibitors (cough, angioedema)

In patients who qualify for initiation of drug therapy, 2-4 weekly follow up would be needed to be advised to monitor response to therapy and achievement of BP target. The doctor at the PHC/CHC can record the initial BP in the patient record, and the patient can be monitored for response at the field level by health auxiliaries, or again at the health facility, according to the circumstances. If the patient achieves reduction of BP to target levels, then they would continue the same therapy and be monitored every 2-3 monthly at the PHC level. In case the target BP is not achieved, then increasing the dose or addition of a new drug would be considered.

The administration of two drugs in patients in grade 3 hypertension should initially be as two separate pills. Once target BP has been achieved, then a combination pill with the individual drugs in the same proportion, i.e. a single pill combination (SPC), if available, may be considered.

- Reduce dose of amlodipine to 2.5 mg once a day when it is started in low body weight elderly patients, and when amlodipine is added to another antihypertensive medication.

§ Reduce dose to enalapril 2.5 mg when it is used in elderly (&gt;65 years) and when the patient has been on diuretic therapy.

85Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

# Use dose of 25 mg in patients less than 50 kg (Canadian labelling)

## Rationale:

Use of initial monotherapy : Most of the evidence based guidelines like CHEP, ESC/ESH recommend therapy with a single drug in the case of grade 1 hypertension (19, 21) , and with a combination of 2 drugs in patients with grade 2 hypertension. NICE however recommends treatment of grade 2 patients with a single drug initially (18) , while JNC 8 recommends that the physician may at his/her discretion, initiate treatment of both grade 1 and grade 2 hypertension with one or two drugs. (20) We decided on the basis of consensus, to recommend a single drug therapy in grade 1 &amp; 2 and with 2 drugs in the case of grade 3 hypertension, in India.

Therapeutic strategy to achieve control of BP: There is no RCT based evidence on the best therapeutic strategy to achieve the target BP. The JNC 8 report has suggested the following strategies for achievement of target BP. These are as follows

1. Select a drug from one of the following classes: calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or thiazide diuretics.
2. Select one of the following strategies to achieve control

- i. Start one drug, titrate to maximal dose, and then add drug from another class.
- ii. Start one drug, add drug from another class if not controlled. Finally titrate to maximal dose of initial drug.
- iii. Start with 2 drugs initially as individual drugs or as a single pill combination.

3. Add a drug from a third class. Maximise doses till control of BP is achieved.

We suggest the following strategy based on the above recommendation in this guideline:

Step 1 therapy: In patients with Grade 1 and Grade 2 hypertension, we suggest initiation with the usual doses of ACE inhibitors/Calcium channel blockers/Thiazide diuretics mentioned in table.

Step 2 therapy: This involves either use of 2 drugs or using maximal doses of the initial drug. Maximising drug doses of the initial drug is less preferable because of the dose plateau relationship in antihypertensive drugs, and because of the likelihood of appearance of adverse effects at high doses. We recommend Step 2 therapy for control of BP in either failure of Step 1 therapy in Grade 1 HT or Grade 2 HT or as initial treatment of patients with Grade 3 HT.

Step 3 therapy: This involves addition of a drug from a third class of drugs

Single pill combinations : The use of single pill combinations has been suggested as they reduce the number of pills to be taken and have been associated with modest improvements in compliance, and non-significant improvement in persistence of therapy and efficacy. (71) .If SPCs are used as initial therapy then titration of dose is difficult since increased dose of one is not possible without increasing the dose of the other. Other factors which need to be considered are availability of 3 combinations in the public health system, the often higher cost of these combinations compared to their constituent drugs in India, and the logistics of maintaining stocks of both single ingredient and combinations of certain drugs. At the moment there is uncertain availability of even single ingredient antihypertensives in public health facilities in India. (72) We therefore recommend the imp

Doses of drugs : The doses recommended need some explanation. In the case of some drugs like thiazide diuretics, it has been seen that the antihypertensive efficacy does not increase at a dose beyond 25 mg while the metabolic side effects escalate with increase in dose .(70) In the case of ACE inhibitors little added antihypertensive efficacy has been noted for example with enalapril above the dose of 10 mg, (73) although doses of up to 40 mg for hypertension have been mentioned in guidelines. (24) A lower dose of some drugs has been mentioned for elderly (&gt; 65 years) in the case of enalapril and amlodipine (especially if the patient has low body weight and is frail).

Time period to achieve BP target : Control of BP to target BP without causing adverse effects can improve adherence to treatment by gaining the patient's confidence. The evidence based guidelines do not address the question of the time period over which target BP should be reached specifically. However the ASH/ISH guidelines, on the basis of consensus, mentions that an effective treatment regime should be established within 6-8 weeks, (24) and we have adopted this recommendation. Drug doses may be increased or additional drugs introduced at 2 weekly intervals.

## Review and respond to possible causes of poor response to BP medications

## 4.7. Key Recommendations:

When a patient does not respond to two drugs given in full doses, the physician should review the underlying issues -related to

-  BP measurements,
-  poor adherence to drug and lifestyle modifications, including stoppage of medicines due to belief in other systems of medicine
-  suboptimal treatment regimens,
-  presence of associated conditions,
-  use of non-antihypertensive drugs which can interfere with the action of anti-hypertensives, and
-  Consider the possibility of secondary hypertension.

When a patient does not respond to two drugs, the physician should review the underlying issues -related to BP measurements, poor adherence to drug and lifestyle modifications, suboptimal treatment regimens, presence of associated conditions, drug interactions, and consider the possibility of secondary hypertension.

## Background:

Although the means to control BP effectively now exist, only a minority of patients are well controlled on therapy. In India BP reduction to target levels was achieved in only 11% of rural Indians and 20% of urban Indians who are hypertensive. (8) .This is undesirable as control of BP is a highly cost-effective intervention for the prevention of cardiovascular mortality, heart attack and stroke.

Most patients can be controlled with 1 or 2 antihypertensives, especially combinations of ACE inhibitors with calcium channel blockers or diuretics. Some patients have resistant hypertension which may even require more than 3 antihypertensive drugs to control. However more commonly we may have 'pseudo resistant' hypertension as a result of measurement, patient, and drug therapy related factors mentioned above. Once these factors have been excluded, there may be secondary causes of hypertension underlying the difficult to control hypertension.

## Implementation:

When a patient is not responding to BP medications, as determined by persistently high BP readings on repeat visits, the physician should pay attention to the following factors:

1. Issues related to BP measurement in the clinic: This may include 'white coat effect' because of which the clinic based BP measurements by a doctor may be higher than those obtained at home or by another healthcare provider. Improper size of cuff and improper technique may also give falsely elevated BP readings.

89Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

2. Adherence to medications: In a chronic disease, which are asymptomatic, patients often miss doses or even discontinue medications, and the regularity of drug intake should be enquired about from the patient and their relatives. The reasons for non-adherence should also be explored which may include doubts about the diagnosis, belief in lifestyle modifications being sufficient, cost of therapy, or side effects related to medicines. Belief in other systems of medicine may also lead to stoppage of medicines
3. Adherence to lifestyle modifications: Excessive salt intake, excessive alcohol consumption, tobacco use, obesity all can contribute to poor control of hypertension.
4. Suboptimal treatment regimens: This can be the result of low doses, or use of inappropriate combinations. Drug dosages should be optimised. The combinations should be of medicines which are complementary in action. Addition of diuretics in patients not responding to a combination of drugs, usually results in good control.
5. Presence of associated conditions: Presence of sleep apnea, chronic pain can all impair control of BP.
6. Drug interactions: Some commonly used drugs like non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, corticosteroids and anabolic steroids, and common cold remedies which contain sympathomimetics can all result in higher BP. NSAIDs ( including cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) can cause salt retention and interfere with the action of all antihypertensives except calcium channel blockers. Addition of a diuretic may mitigate their effect.
7. Secondary hypertension: The most frequent cause of secondary hypertension is chronic kidney disease, which can be diagnosed on the abnormal urinalysis&amp; blood chemistries, at the level of the CHC. The other causes of secondary hypertension would include endocrine causes (pheochromocytoma, Cushing's' syndrome), vascular causes (renovascular hypertension, coarctation of aorta, Takayasu's arteritis); which will require evaluation at a medical college level.

## Rationale/Evidence:

The factors underlying poor response to antihypertensives have been enumerated in the CHEP guidelines, and have been adapted from this source . (19)

## 4.8. Therapy of hypertension and associated conditions:

## 4.8.1 Diabetes mellitus:

- 4.8.1.1 Patients with diabetes mellitus should be initiated on drug treatment when the SBP is greater than 140 mm Hg, and the target for control should be a SBP of less than 140 mm Hg, and a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg.
- 4.8.1.2 ACE inhibitors are preferred as initial therapy and calcium channel blockers and diuretics may be used as add on therapy. Thiazide diuretics can be associated with glucose intolerance.

90Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

- 4.8.1.3 Drugs which inhibit the renin angiotensin systems- ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be used if the patients have proteinuria (or microalbuminuria).

## 4.8.2 Heart disease:

- 4.8.2.1 Beta-blockers should be prescribed in patients with hypertension and a recent myocardial infarction. These patients should also receive an ACE inhibitor.
- 4.8.2.3. In patients with angina, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, should be considered among the antihypertensive drugs for their effect on symptoms.
- 4.8.2.3 In patients with heart failure and hypertension, ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are recommended for reduction in mortality and hospitalization.

## 4.8.3 Kidney disease (diabetic or non-diabetic):

- 4.8.3.1 The target for BP reduction should be a SBP of less than 140 mm Hg, but a SBP of less than 130 mm Hg should be considered for those with overt proteinuria.
- 4.8.3.2 ACE inhibitors /ARBs are effective in reducing albuminuria and should be used in patients with hypertension and overt proteinuria (or microalbuminuria ). Monitoring serum creatinine and potassium in the first week of therapy is advisable after initiation of therapy or any increase in the dose of ACE inhibitors.
- 4.8.3.3 Use of ACE inhibitors and Thiazide or thiazide like diuretics should be used as other antihypertensive agents, and in the presence of volume overload, loop diuretics like frusemide may be used.

## 4.8.4 Cerebrovascular disease:

- 4.8.4.1 Prevention of stroke can occur with all classes of antihypertensive drugs if BP is effectively controlled.
- 4.8.4.2 In patients with a history of stroke or TIA, initiation of drug treatment should be considered even with Grade 1 hypertension, and a systolic BP of less than 140 mm Hg should be targeted. An ACE inhibitor/ARB is considered an initial drug.

- 4.8.4.3 In the first 72 hours of an ischemic stroke, do not administer antihypertensive treatment, since excessive lowering of BP can exacerbate the existing ischemia.
- 4.8.4.4 In patients who are not undergoing thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke, extreme values of BP, e.g. systolic BP &gt; 220 mm Hg or diastolic BP &gt; 120 mm Hg should be treated by agents to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 15% in the first hour and no more than 25% in the first 24 hours and with gradual reduction thereafter. In patients who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy, BP above systolic of 185 mm Hg and diastolic of 110 mm Hg should be treated cautiously and maintained below these levels.
- 4.8.4.5 In patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, with SBP &gt; 200 mm Hg or MAP 7 &gt;150 mm Hg, aggressive reduction of blood pressure with intravenous infusion of antihypertensives is indicated and the patient should be examined every 5 minutes.
- 4.8.4.6 In patients with intracerebral haemorrhage , with SBP &gt;180 mm Hg or MAP &gt; 130 mm Hg, modest reduction of BP to 160/90 is indicated using an intermittent or continuous IV infusion with frequent re-examination is indicated.
- 4.8.4.7 In patients presenting with intracerebral haemorrhage and a SBP of 150-220 mm Hg, BP can probably be lowered to a SBP of 140 mm Hg safely.

## Background:

Patients with hypertension often have associated conditions like diabetes, clinical cardiovascular disease with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease. Some classes of antihypertensive drugs have special roles in the presence of such conditions, some drugs are best avoided in the presence of conditions like chronic kidney disease, while in other conditions like acute stroke, reduction of elevated BP in general by any class of drugs, should be cautious.

## Implementation:

The evaluation of these clinical conditions would be best done at the CHC level, where in addition to the history and physical examination, the patient could be subjected to

Investigations like X-ray chest (cardiomegaly in case of heart failure), ECG (reveal changes suggestive of ischemic heart disease), renal function tests (abnormal in patients with chronic kidney disease) and urinalysis. Patients with chronic kidney disease and heart disease may require monitoring and follow up at the CHC level, while patients with diabetes and previous cerebrovascular disease may be followed up at the PHC level with periodic review at the CHC. The group recommends that the doctors at the PHC level need to be empowered to deal with hypertension and

7 MAP = Mean arterial pressure which is calculated as follows MAP = SBP +2(DBP)where SBP is systolic blood pressure and DBP is diastolic blood pressure 3

diabetes, and the patients should get access to investigations like serum creatinine, lipids and ECG through a referral arrangement with the CHC.

## Rationale:

The issue of treatment of associated conditions is addressed by guidelines like ESC/ESH, JNC 8 and CHEP, though not specifically by NICE. There is broad consensus between these guidelines on the choice of drugs for the treatment of hypertension in the presence of associated conditions.

Diabetes : However there is some variation in the targets for BP control across guidelines. CHEP guidelines for example recommend lower systolic and diastolic BP targets for patients with diabetes (systolic BP &lt; 130 mm Hg and diastolic BP &lt; 80 mm Hg) ,(19) while the European guidelines recommend a diastolic BP target of less than 85 mm Hg while recommending the same systolic BP target of 140 mm Hg. The JNC 8 guideline specifically reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials in favour of lower targets for systolic and diastolic BP in diabetics and concluded that there was insufficient evidence supporting them, and suggested similar targets as for the general population. (20) We decided to adopt the JNC 8 recommendation in light of the evidence presented in them and the conclusions of a recent Cochrane review which were similar to the JNC 8 recommendations. (61) Also a similar target for BP control in diabetics as well as the general population would favour guideline implementation.

Cerebrovascular diseases: The recommendations regarding antihypertensive treatment in patients with ischemic stroke has been adopted from the CHEP guidelines, (19) the ESC/ESH guidelines and the Seventh Report of the JNC. The recommendations related to blood pressure management in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage has been adapted from a recent guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association .(74) Recent studies have demonstrated the lack of an ischemic penumbra in hemorrhagic strokes, and the reduction of BP in the acute phase of stroke can be safely undertaken.

## 4.9 Hypertension in the elderly:

- 4.9.1 Postural hypotension is more common in elderly people. Assess patients for postural hypotension at diagnosis and on follow up by checking BP in sitting and in standing position after 2 minutes.
- 4.9.2 Postural fall of &gt;20 mm in systolic and &gt;10 mm diastolic indicates postural hypotension is a risk factor for falls.
- 4.9.3 In a patient with postural hypotension titrate target according to standing BP.
- 4.9.4 Start therapy with lower doses of drugs and change doses or add drugs at a slower rate in elderly patients.
- 4.9.5 In elderly patients less than 80 years of age, the blood pressure target for control may be &lt;140 mm systolic and &lt;90 mm diastolic if the patient is fit and the treatment is well tolerated.
- 4.9.6 In elderly patients more than 80 years (the very elderly), the blood pressure target for control is &lt;150 mm systolic and &lt;90 mm diastolic.

93Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

- 4.9.7 The drug of choice for initiation of therapy in the elderly is a long acting calcium channel blocker, or a low dose thiazide diuretic in the absence of compelling indications.
- 4.9.8 There is a higher likelihood of certain side effects in the elderly- e.g. hyponatremia in the case of thiazides, and hyperkalemia in the case of ACE inhibitors.
- 4.9.9 There is a likelihood of drug -drug interactions in the elderly who often receive other drugs; e.g. .NSAIDs for arthritis interferes with action of ACE inhibitors, and diuretics.

## 4.10 Hypertensive emergencies:

- 4.10.1 Hypertensive emergencies are those in which severe hypertension (elevations of systolic &gt;180 mm Hg) and/ or diastolic (&gt; 120 mm Hg) is associated with symptoms and signs of acute ongoing organ damage. Such elevations of blood pressure may be associated with neurologic emergencies (hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebral infarction, and cerebral haemorrhage), cardiac emergencies (acute left ventricular failure, acute coronary syndrome), renal emergencies like acute renal failure, and obstetric emergencies like eclampsia (symptoms and signs of such dysfunction are referred to under the mnemonic of 'ABCDEFG' in pathway on assessment and management on hypertensive crisis). Eclampsia can occur even at levels of BP less than 180 mm systolic and/or 120 mm diastolic.
- 4.10.2 The magnitude and rate of reduction of BP varies according to the organ involvement in the hypertensive emergency. In many hypertensive emergencies including hypertensive encephalopathy reduction of mean arterial pressure of ≤ 25 percent in the first hour, with a gradual reduction to 160 mm systolic and diastolic of 110-120 mm Hg over 2-6 hours, and gradual normalization of blood pressure over 24-48 hours is recommended. Parenteral agents like IV labetalol, nicardipine may be used initially with a change to oral agents later.
- 4.10.3 In patients with ischemic stroke as noted earlier, reduction of systolic BP below 220 mm Hg and 120 mm Hg are not treated, unless the patient is being considered for thrombolytic therapy.
- 4.10.4 Negative recommendation: Oral or sublingual nifedipine may cause excessive, abrupt fall of blood pressure which may result in cardiac, cerebral or renal ischemic complications. It is not recommended in the treatment of any hypertensive emergency.
- 4.10.5 In the case of acute left ventricular failure reduction of the elevated BP is indicated with a parenteral loop diuretic like frusemide in addition to vasodilators like nitroglycerine. In patients with acute coronary syndrome with severe hypertension,

intravenous nitroglycerine may be used in association with intravenous beta-blockers like esmolol or labetalol.

- 4.10.6 Patients with a hypertensive emergency should be examined for any clinical clues to the presence of secondary hypertension and be evaluated for the same.

## 4.11 Hypertensive urgencies:

4.11.1 This refers to situations when severe hypertension (SBP &gt; 180 mm, DBP&gt; 110 mm) is not associated with any signs of acute or ongoing organ damage (cerebral, cardiac, renal, visual), and the patient is relatively asymptomatic except for a mild headache (none of the symptoms or signs referred in the mnemonic 'ABCDEFG' in the pathway on assessment and management of hypertensive crisis). Patients with severe hypertension should be assessed clinically and by laboratory investigations, and target organ damage should be excluded before hypertensive urgency is diagnosed.

4.11.2. Hypertensive urgencies may occur in patients with chronic hypertension in a number of situations. This includes non-adherence to therapy, after sudden withdrawal of betablocker or clonidine therapy, after ingestion of large quantity of salt, or due to anxiety.

- 4.11.3 There is no benefit from rapid reduction of BP in patients with severe but asymptomatic hypertension and the BP should be reduced over a period of hours and days.
- 4.11.4. Nursing the patient in a quiet room and relief of anxiety may reduce BP to a certain extent.
- 4.11.5. Negative recommendation: Do not attempt excessive, rapid and uncontrolled reduction of blood pressure in hypertensive urgencies, with intravenous drugs or oral or sublingual nifedipine . This aggressive reduction of BP in a patient with severe asymptomatic hypertension may cause fall of BP below the threshold of autoregulation in vascular beds, and cause serious cerebral and cardiac complications related to ischemia.
- 4.11.6 Re-institution of therapy or intensification of therapy by increasing the dose of drugs or adding a diuretic may suffice for gradual reduction of blood pressure in a patient who has developed severe asymptomatic hypertension on the background of chronic hypertension.
- 4.11.7 If BP reduction over few hours is required in view of imminent cardiovascular events, then oral frusemide, oral clonidine can be used. These can be followed by long term therapy with CCBs, ACE inhibitors or diuretics.

## Background:

95Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

Severe elevations of BP can be asymptomatic and can occur in those with undiagnosed, uncontrolled hypertension or in hypertensive patients who were on therapy but were non-adherent or have stopped some agents like beta-blockers or clonidine suddenly. Such asymptomatic severe elevation of BP termed 'hypertensive urgencies' demand reduction of BP over hours and days. Severe hypertension may be associated with life-threatening events involving cardiac, cerebral or renal systems, in which case the term 'hypertensive emergency' is used and BP is reduced appropriately over minutes to hours. Appropriate management of hypertension in these situations can prevent morbidity and mortality, while inappropriate management which includes sudden excessive reduction of BP may result in serious complications.

## Implementation:

Physicians will need to be trained in the clinical and laboratory assessment of severe hypertension and to distinguish between hypertensive urgency and an emergency

Patients with hypertensive emergencies have symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities suggestive of cardiac, cerebral, renal complications, listed in the table below, and will need care at a secondary/tertiary care facility. However treatment should not be delayed and the patient should be referred after an initial reduction of BP.

The healthcare facility will need to keep stock of certain essential medicines for the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies. These are indicated in the table below. A minimum list would contain IV frusemide, IV labetalol, and IV nitroglycerine.

Rationale: There is no good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide the management of patients with acute severe hypertension with/without complications, and current recommendations The and are based on the Seventh Report. (29)

## 4.12 Integration with other interventions to reduce cardiovascular risks

- 4.12.1 The treatment of hypertension should be integrated with treatment of associated risk factors like lipid lowering therapy and antiplatelet therapy, apart from lifestyle interventions already mentioned.
- 4.12.2 Antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (75 mg/day) is recommended in patients with controlled hypertension who have previous history of cardiovascular event (previous MI, stroke, angina, bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty), because of a favourable benefit -harm ratio.
- 4.12.7 Low dose aspirin may be considered for those hypertensives who are well controlled and have a high cardiovascular risk (Grade 3 hypertension, 3 or more risk factors, target organ damage).
- 4.12.8 Negative recommendation: Do not use low-dose aspirin in hypertensive patients without cardiovascular disease and who are at low-moderate risk

as the risk of major bleeds (intracranial and gastrointestinal) outweighs the potential benefit.

- 4.12.9 The use of low dose aspirin in patients with diabetes without cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease is not recommended in view of the uncertain risk-benefit ratio.
- 4.12.10 Regardless of presence/absence of hypertension statins are recommended in the following patient groups 8
-  Patients with overt atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease), regardless of age.
-  Patients with age with ≥ 21 years, where LDL -cholesterol is more than 190 mg/dl, and where secondary cause of hyperlipidemia has been excluded.
-  In patients who are diabetic and in the age group of 40-75 years, and LDL cholesterol is between 70-189 mg/dl
- 4.12.7. Statins are indicated in hypertensive patients aged more than 40 years with high cardiovascular risk (3 or more cardiovascular risk factors) 9
- 4.12.11 Hypertensive patients who smoke or chew tobacco should be provided advice to stop smoking and chewing tobacco.

## Background

Aspirin is used for its antiplatelet effect in patients for prevention of cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) death. Aspirin use however also carries a risk of increase in incidence of major bleeds - gastrointestinal or intracranial.

Lowering lipid levels to target levels lowers cardiovascular risks in those with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. The relative benefits of lowering statins are greatest in those who are also diabetic. However they contribute the highest additional costs to antihypertensive treatment. Where the cost factor may be a major cause for default from treatment, the costs benefits of adding statins should be carefully considered and discussed with the patient.

## Implementation:

Aspirin: Aspirin in a dose of 75 mg should be available in the public health system for use in well controlled hypertensives that have had a previous cardiovascular event like previous MI or angina, bypass surgery or angioplasty, or stroke. In patients without cardiovascular disease , aspirin should be considered in those with a high cardiovascular risk - as discussed in the section on assessment, these would be patients with controlled Grade 2 /Grade 3 hypertension, with 3 or more risk factors, or with organ damage.

Statins: Some statins e.g. atorvastatin are off-patent and available in quality assured public pooled procurements for as low as Rs. 0.22 for a 10 mg tablet(seeh ttp://www.tnmsc.com/tnmsc/new/user\_pages/drugtender.php?

drugcat=drug2015). The indications for statin use are fairly clear cut for three categories of patients - Those with existing cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes in the age group of 40-79 years, and those with a LDL-C of &gt; 190 mg/dl. Physicians at the PHC and CHC level can be trained in the use of statins and recognise these indications for statin therapy. With the availability of statins of generic origin and trained health personnel, risk reduction with statins in terms of allcause mortality, nonfatal MI and stroke, for patients with hypertension with cardiovascular disease in India is feasible in the public health system.

## Rationale:

Use of Aspirin: Aspirin due to its antiplatelet effect has the potential to reduce cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction, stroke and other such complications. However its use is also associated with higher risk of gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds. It should be used therefore when the benefit outweighs the possible harm. Evidence based guidelines like the ESH/ESC, after reviewing the data from recent large meta-analysis (75), have indicated the situations where the potential benefit outweighs the harms, and recommended aspirin in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. (21) We have adopted these recommendations. When aspirin is used for primary prevention, it does reduce the risk of MI, but its effect on reducing risk of stroke and CVD death is inconclusive, whereas the possibility of harm remain. (76) The prescription of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is based on judgement of the healthcare provider who must weight possible benefit against the risk of major bleeding. (76) In patients with diabetes, the existing data suggests that aspirin use is associated with a modest but not statistically significant reduction in stroke and myocardial infarction. (77)

Statin therapy : Statin therapy has been recommended as part of global vascular protection or treatment of associated risk factors in some of the guidelines e.g. CHEP and the ESC/ESH guidelines. There is consensus that these are effective in lowering mortality, risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease. (19, 21) In such patients statins are an adjunct to diet, exercise, effective control of hypertension and smoking cessation. (19 ) The use of statins may increase the absolute risk of diabetes by 1%, especially in those with features of the metabolic syndrome, and are associated with a risk of muscle damage .(78) Myositis occurs in about 5-10% of recipients. The use of statins in patients without cardiovascular disease requires discussion of the possible adverse effects of statins with the patients. Use of statins in such individuals has been recommended for example if the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease exceeds a threshold determined by risk assessment tools. The caveats with this calculation based 99Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document approach are that the pooled cohort equation and the data, on which these risk assessment tools are modelled, are not based on the Indian population. The CHEP guidelines have however defined a high risk individual as someone with 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors out of a list of 11 factors .(19) This is an approach that might be feasible to implement in a public health programme in India.

Hypertensive patients who smoke or chew tobacco should be provided brief advice to stop smoking and chewing tobacco.

Background: Tobacco use which includes smoking and chewing tobacco is a major avoidable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease .(79) In the INTERHEART study which examined the risk of myocardial infarction with tobacco use in 52 countries, the odds ratio for myocardial infarction associated with current smoking cigarettes, smoking beedies, and chewing tobacco were 2.95, 2.89, and 2.23 respectively. The highest risk was associated with current smokers who also chewed tobacco (OR: 4.09). (79) Studies suggest smoking causes up to 60% of cardiovascular disease in urban men in India which is higher than in richer countries. (80) Cessation of tobacco use is therefore an integral component of global vascular protection for patients with hypertension.

I mplementation: Assess history of tobacco use as smoking or chewing, and consider appropriate brief interventions as an integral part of hypertension management, which have been well described in the operational guidelines of the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke. (15) This part of treatment can be done by non- medical staff if they are provided information and skills in this area.

## Rationale:

Systematic reviews of a large number of randomized controlled trials have established that brief physician advice to stop smoking can lead to significant increases in smoking cessation .(81) Brief interventions using non-judgemental and evidence based methods are effective, feasible, cost nothing and carry large benefits to those with hypertension. Also combining advice on tobacco cessation with pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy, administration of bupropion, and varenicline) also resulted in a higher likelihood of sustained quitting.

## 5. Monitoring, follow up and improving adherence to therapy

## Key Recommendations:

- 5.1 A simplified regime using long acting drugs which can be used once a day may improve adherence.
- 5.2 The patients should be monitored for efficacy of the regimen, both at the clinic and community level. In patients who are yet to achieve target BP, follow-up visits at 1-2 weeks can be scheduled till target BP is achieved. Thereafter the patient can be seen by a physician at a frequency determined by the severity of the hypertension, presence of comorbidities, target organ damage. Streamlined methods to collect drugs should be allowed to enable compliance by the patient.
- 5.3. The patients should be monitored for side effects of drugs.
- 5.4. The common side effect of calcium channel blockers is peripheral edema, which is dose dependent and may subside with reduction of dose or combination with ACE inhibitor.
- 5.4.1. The common side effects of diuretics are metabolic side effects like hypokalemia, hyperglycemia but which are less frequent when these are used in doses of 12.5 mg and when they are combined with ACE inhibitors.. A particular concern is of thiazide induced hyponatremia which is commoner in the elderly, those with a low body weight. This can develop rapidly and manifest as altered consciousness, and even seizures, and may require hospitalisation and administration of normal or hypertonic saline.
- 5.4.2. The common side effect of ACE inhibitors is dry cough, which may necessitate withdrawal of therapy. There is a risk of hypotension when ACE inhibitors are started on patients who are on diuretics, or are on very low salt diet. A small rise in serum creatinine can occur on ACE inhibitors, which is reversible. Hyperkalemia can develop with high doses of ACE inhibitors, but also more commonly in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, concurrent use of potassium sparing diuretics, and the elderly.
- 5.5. Consider the use of pill counts, participation of a family member in supervision of drug intake, periodic counselling and provision of patient information leaflets to improve adherence and control.
- 5.6 Diagnosis and management of hypertension in India, needs to be embedded in the system of primary care. A team approach to management of hypertension needs to be evolved which involves the physicians, allied staff and community based health workers.

- 5.7 Community based health workers can be trained to play a critical role in meeting the challenge of undetected, untreated and uncontrolled hypertension in India. They can improve detection, promote lifestyle modifications, monitor response and ensure adherence to therapy. They can also help prevent hypertension by advising appropriate lifestyle modifications in those who have a high normal BP ( 130-139 mm Hg systolic and 85-89 mm Hg diastolic)
- 5.8 We strongly recommend creation of a hypertension registry at the PHC &amp; CHC level to ensure tracking of patients and create a system of recall which can involve the community based health workers.
- 5.9. Patients with hypertension should be encouraged to consider home blood pressure monitoring using an automated device which has been validated with a clinic based device.
- 5.10. All patients with hypertension, should undergo an annual review of control of BP, implementation of lifestyle modifications (e.g. maintenance of body weight), target organ damage (proteinuria), review of treatment including side effects of drugs.

  5.11 All patients with high normal BP should also be encouraged to undergo an annual review, and advised appropriate lifestyle modifications e.g. dietary changes, weight maintenance, and abstinence from tobacco .

Background : Screening and initiation of therapy for hypertension is worthwhile only if it can be sustained. Many patients commenced on treatment remain with uncontrolled hypertension because of poor treatment adherence. Since adherence is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, poverty, poor access to care, patient's perceptions about the need and benefit of lifelong therapy, availability of medications in the public health system, the quality of interactions and communication between healthcare providers and patients, concerns about costs and side effects of therapy all demand careful consideration in the management of patients with hypertension Monitoring of ongoing treatment compliance and recalls are necessary to help treatment compliance. Community based health workers can assist in recalls.

## Implementation:

Patient education about the need and benefits of therapy in preventing lifethreatening complications is essential for adherence and healthcare providers would need to be trained in providing guidance to patients with hypertension. In patients where this is possible, home BP monitoring may aid adherence to the regime.

The patient may be asked to tailor his intake of pills to fit his daily habits. A simplified regime using long acting drugs which can be used once a day may improve adherence. When multiple anti-hypertensives are being given, a single pill combination can be considered. The use of pill counts, participation of a family member in supervision of drug intake, periodic counselling and provision of patient

103Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document information leaflets may be considered to improve adherence and control. A sample patient information leaflet is provided.

The patients should be monitored for efficacy as well as safety of the regimes used. They should be aware of the common side effects of the drugs being used.

A paper or computer based monitoring system for chronic diseases should be maintained for the target population of a primary health care provider which recognises failure to adhere to treatment. There should be an organised system of interventions when a patient defaults, so that default is not due to lack of knowledge, financial resources or lack of access to health services. Recall systems are effective if they are non-judgemental and respectful of patient choices.

## Rationale:

The framework for adherence and the evidence for action have been developed in a WHO document which this guideline draws upon . (82) Among the hypertension related guidelines the CHEP and ESC/ESH guidelines have recommended the multipronged and team approach for management of hypertension, although the evidence base is weak. The above points for action are adapted from these guidelines. According to a systematic review , the involvement of community health workers can improve the control of blood pressure, appointment keeping and adherence to medications, healthcare utilisation and even cardiovascular outcomes.

| Abdominal obesity      | Abdominal obesity, also known as central obesity, is when excessiveabdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen has built up to the extent that it is likely to have a negative impact on health. It is assessed by measuring the waist circumference or calculating the ratio of the circumference at the waist to that at the hip (waist-hip ratio). Abdominal obesity has been strongly linked to risk of cardiovascular disease. |

## ANNEXURE 2: LIFE STYLE MODIFICATIONS IN HYPERTENSION

Life style changes recommended for patients diagnosed to have hypertension and for those at risk of developing hypertension

## Background:

Lifestyle modifications are an integral part of the management of persons with hypertension, regardless of severity of hypertension. Reduction of BP following lifestyle modifications may suffice for the control of grade I hypertension, while they may aid the control of hypertension and reduce the dosages of drugs required for control of other grades of hypertension. Lifestyle modifications also help to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk in a person with hypertension.

Lifestyle modifications are also an integral part of the prevention of hypertension at both an individual and the population level, and may help prevent progression of high normal BP to hypertensive levels.

## 1. Physical Activity (adapted from ref. (84))

-  Physical activity includes daily activity like walking and cycling, household work, work related activity, and leisure activity. Moderate intensity physical activity of 30 minutes per day or at least 2.5 hours (150 mins) per week, which can be performed in bouts of 10 minutes or more in 4-7 sessions per week, should be advised to all individuals for its cardioprotective effect . Moderate intensity physical activity includes any activity which can increase the heart rate, make the breathing rapid and make the body warmer such as brisk walking (at 3-4 mph), stair-climbing, light swimming, walking the treadmill at 3-4 mph, or . 45 minutes (accumulated) exercise per day is recommended for cardiovascular fitness, while 60 minutes (accumulated) per day is recommended for weight reduction. The specific form of physical activity chosen by or for the patient should be enjoyable and sustainable.
-  Alternatively persons can indulge in 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity like running (at 6-8 mph), cycling at 12-14 mph. This kind of activity makes the breathing very hard, the heartbeat rapid and makes it difficult to carry on a conversation comfortably.
-  All adults should include physical activities to improve muscle strength at least twice a week.

-  Regular aerobic exercises can reduce the systolic blood pressure average of 4 mmHg and diastolic BP by an average of 2.5 mmHg. (29)
-  Epidemiologic evidence suggests that physical activity reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is strong evidence that regular physical activity has an independent cardio protective effect. Physical activity improves cardiorespiratory fitness, lowers SBP and DBP, improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, helps reduce and control weight, and lowers markers of inflammation .(53)
-  Chronically sedentary individuals should not start a program of vigorous activity suddenly, but should gradually increase the duration and intensity of physical activity, starting for example with 10 minutes of moderate activity per session . (85) This is done to minimise the risk of a sudden cardiac event and musculoskeletal injuries. Any patient experiencing chest discomfort, jaw pain, palpitations, syncope or dyspnea, should undergo evaluation before continuing with exercise. Patients with decompensated heart failure and acute coronary syndromes should not embark on an exercise program.

2. Weight Reduction : achieve and maintain desirable body weight.

All individuals who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to lose weight through a combination of a reduced calorie diet, increased physical activity and behaviour modification. Dietary changes and recommendations for physical

116Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document activity are mentioned in other sections.

Overweight or obesity is assessed by measuring body mass index (BMI), which is calculated as weight in kg/height in meter 2 . For Indian population 18.5 to 22.9 BMI is normal, 23 to 24.9 is considered as overweight and BMI of ≥25 kg/m 2 is considered as obesity in Indians. 10 Apart from BMI which is a measure of general adiposity, it is also important to measure the abdominal adiposity, which is also associated with a higher cardiovascular risk. Abdominal adiposity can be measured by measurement of the waist circumference and the waist-hip ratio. The waist circumference is measured at the end of several consecutive natural breaths, midpoint between the top of the iliac crest and the lower margin of the last palpable rib in the mid axillary line. Waist circumference should be &lt;90 cm for men and &lt;80 cm for women. Another measure of central obesity is Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), which is the waist circumference divided by the hip circumference. The hip circumference is measured at the maximum circumference of the buttocks. Normal WHR is &lt;0.85 for women and &lt;0.90 for men.

## 3. Alcohol Consumption

-  Reducing alcohol intake can lower the blood pressure substantially. On other hand moderate drinking and binge drinking increases the blood pressure and risk of developing hypertension.
-  Zero alcohol consumption is recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have pregnancy and also for those hypertensives that had already suffering from a complication due to hypertension like stroke, heart disease or renal disease.
-  Alcohol consumption is measured in terms of units of alcohol (UK) or standard drinks (e.g. Australia, USA). 1 unit of alcohol is 10 ml ethanol (around 8 gms ethanol), while 1 standard drink contains 10 g ethanol (Australia) or 14 g ethanol (USA).
-  The no. of units consumed per day can be calculated using the drink volume and the Alcohol by volume which is mentioned as a percentage on the container. E.g. Beer may be around 5% ABV, wine is around 12.5%, while whisky and vodka are around 40% ABV.
-  The number of units of alcohol = Drink volume x ABV /1000. Therefore 100 ml of whisky will be 100 x 40/1000= 4 units.
-  Healthy adults should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units per day in the case of men and 2-3 units in the case of women. If there has been heavy alcohol consumption, there should be no alcohol intake for 48 hours.
-  Tips on cutting down should be offered to patients and should be employed in an incremental fashion(86) : These include keeping track of alcohol intake ( including counting and measuring) and keeping intake within recommended limits, setting goals for consumption, drinking slowly and preferably with some food in the stomach. In patients who have decided to quit, avoiding triggers, dealing with urges, and refusing offers of drinks politely are of vital importance. Talking and enlisting the support of spouses, non-drinking friends, and mutual support groups like alcoholics anonymous are also very helpful.

## 4. Tobacco cessation

Non-smokers should be encouraged not to start smoking. (87) All smokers should be encouraged to quit smoking, and should be supported by the health professional in their efforts to do so. (87)

Patients who use other forms of tobacco should be motivated to stop doing so.

-  Smoking cessation may not reduce the blood pressure directly but markedly reduces overall cardiovascular risk. The risk of myocardial infarction is 2-6 times higher and the risk of stroke is 3 times higher in people who smoke than in non-smokers. Smokers who quit reduce their risk of coronary heart disease.
-  Brief advice from health professionals is effective in helping persons to quit smoking, increasing quit rates. Even 3-5 minutes taken to encourage smokers to attempt to quit can increase success rates.
-  The WHO has recommended a 5 A s approach to aid in smoking cessation in routine practice- The patient should be a sked about smoking status at every opportunity. Then the patient should be a dvised about to quit smoking, and a ssessed about his degree of addiction and readiness to quit. The health professional should a ssist in formulating a smoking cessation strategy including setting a quit date, counselling and other measures, and finally a rrange a follow up visit.
-  Pharmacotherapy to stop smoking with nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, nortryptiline and varenicline are effective and should be offered to motivated smokers who fail to quit with counselling. The risk of adverse effects is small and is generally outweighed by the significant risk of continuing to smoke.

## 5. Dietary Recommendations

All patients should be encouraged to adopt a heart healthy diet.

120Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

Fat: All individuals should be strongly encouraged to reduce total fat and saturated fat intake. Total fat intake should be reduced to about 30% of calories, saturated fat to less than 10% of calories, trans-fatty acids ( present in margarine and bakery products )intake should be reduced as much as possible or eliminated and most dietary fat should be polyunsaturated (up to 10% of calories) or monounsaturated (10-15% of calories). Salt: All individuals should be strongly encouraged to reduce daily salt intake by at least one third and, if possible, to &lt;5g or &lt;90mmol per day. Fruits, vegetables, fibre: All individuals should be encouraged to eat at least 400 g a day of a range of fruits and vegetables as well as whole grains and pulses.

## 6. Salt Intake

All patients should be strongly encouraged to limit their salt intake to &lt; 5 g salt(or 90 mmol) per day as per WHO recommendations. (87) There is lack of representative data on salt intake in India, although in a study in urban India, the mean intake was found to be 8.5 g salt per day. (88)

Reduction of salt intake can be accomplished by not adding additional salt in diet, choosing foods processed without salt, avoiding high-salt processed foods, salty snacks, takeaway foods high in salt and salt added during cooking or at the table.

Preparations which are high in salt and need to be moderated are: Pickles, 121Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document chutneys, sauces and ketchups, papads, chips and salted biscuits, cheese and salted butter, bakery products and dried salted fish.

The above recommendation for dietary salt restriction may have to be individualised in the case of certain occupational exposures. Acclimation to heat occurs rapidly; thus, within a few days of exposure to hot and humid conditions, individuals lose only small amounts of sodium through sweat. But in the case of workers performing intense physical activity under conditions of heat stress, may lose significant amounts of fluid and salt in sweat. In a study it was estimated that a 10 hour shift of working in moderately hot climatic conditions(35 0 C) can result in loss of 10-15 g salt. (89)

## 7. Stress management

-  In hypertensive patients in whom stress may be contributing to blood pressure elevation, stress management should be considered as an intervention.
-  A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of Yoga concluded that there were clinically important effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors and that Yoga could be considered an ancillary intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk. (90) With regard to its role in hypertension management, another systematic review concluded that there was

emerging but low-quality evidence for Yoga as an adjunct to medical therapy, but larger confirmatory studies were required . (91)

## ANNEXURE 3: FORMULARY

## Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with focus on amlodipine.

Pharmacology of CCBs : These drugs interfere with the inward movement of calcium ions through the slow channels of cell membranes in the heart and the vascular smooth muscle. They are divided into 2 major classes , the dihydropyridines CCBs which includes amlodipine,nifedipine, felodipine) which do not have a major negative inotropic effect and no antiarrhythmic activity, and the non-dihydropyridines like verapamil, and diltiazem, which have both significant negative inotropic and antiarrhythmic activity.

Amlodipine: Amlodipine has a very long elimination half- life (35 to 48 hours) and can be given once daily. It has a good safety profile, very few drug interactions, and no adverse effect on glucose, lipid levels. Other agents in this class like cilnidipine, nicardipine, lercanidipine, have no major advantage over amlodipine whose outcome benefits have been established in large trials. An isomer of amlodipine, S-Amlodipine is also marketed in India, along with the amlodipine in its racemic form. The limited high quality data available suggests that there is no difference in therapeutic efficacy as well as adverse effects between the two forms(92). The S-Amlodipine form is more expensive. The racemic amlodipine is available in various forms - amlodipine besilate, amlodipine mesilate, and amlodipine maleate, but these are interchangeable.

## Indications for amlodipine:

Used alone or in combination for hypertension, chronic stable angina, coronary artery disease without heart failure or an ejection fraction &lt;40%

## Dose, titration, and use in combinations

Initial dose: 5 mg once daily. In elderly, small patients, and patients with hepatic impairment, the initial dose may be 2.5 mg once daily. The dose of 2.5 mg may also be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive agents. Dose may be increased at intervals of 7-14 days to achieve BP goals. Doses may be increased up to a maximum of 10 mg once daily.

Amlodipine can be used in combination with ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and low dose diuretics for treatment of hypertension. Use in combination with beta-blockers is of benefit in patients with chronic stable angina.

## Contraindications:

Cardiogenic shock, unstable angina, significant aortic stenosis. Worsening angina or increased risk of myocardial infarction may be seen

## Cautions:

Drug interactions: Beta-blockers enhance hypotensive effect of amlodipine. Amlodipine increases exposure to simvastatin (dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg per day). Amlodipine also increases exposure to ciclosporin and tacrolimus.

## Side effects:

Generally well tolerated. Side effects are dose related and commoner in women. Pedal edema is the chief side effect, seen in around 10% of people on 10 mg daily, and may be decreased in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Headache and flushing related to vasodilation may disappear after a few days.

## Use in Pregnancy and breast feeding

Pregnancy Class C. Use if potential benefits outweigh risk. Avoid in lactation.

## Hepatic impairment: may need dose reduction

Renal impairment: No modification of drug dose is required.

125Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

## Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with focus on enalapril and its use in hypertension

Pharmacology: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs which inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor) and the degradation of bradykinin. They represent a real advance in cardiovascular therapy and have broad spectrum of proven beneficial effects in heart failure, hypertension, renal disease and cardio-protection after myocardial infarction. They are generally well tolerated with no effect on blood glucose or lipids, with adverse effects which are occasional (e.g. cough), or quite rare (e.g. Angioedema). These adverse effects are not dose related. Some adverse effects are seen when administered in patients with heart failure on high dose diuretics (first dose hypotension), or pre-existing renal parenchymal and vascular disease (rise in creatinine, hyperkalaemia), which may be dose related. Use of all ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in pregnancy .

## Indications for enalapril:

## Hypertension, heart failure (all stages), nephropathy (non-diabetic and diabetic), cardio-protection in early phase acute MI and post-MI LV dysfunction.

## Dose, titration, and use in combinations

Initial dose in hypertension: 5 mg in one or two divided doses daily. In patients who have received diuretics, those who were elderly, the initial does may be 2.5 mg 11 . The dose may be usually increased to 10 mg above which the additional benefit may be minimal 12 , although the maximum dose mentioned for hypertension is 20 mg per day.

Enalapril can be used in combination with low dose diuretics, calcium channel blockers for treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors should not be combined with ARBs.

## Contraindications: Pregnancy is a contraindication for use of ACE inhibitors. Bilateral renal artery stenosis. History of hypersensitivity (including angioedema).

## Cautions:

Renal function may be assessed before starting therapy. In patients receiving diuretics especially high dose diuretics, there is a risk of first dose hypotension, which may be minimised by using a low dose of enalapril, close medical supervision. Up to 30% increase in serum creatinine may occur on starting ACE inhibitors, which is reversible. Hyperkalemia can occur if there is renal impairment, is on potassium containing salt substitutes.

## Side effects:

Generally well tolerated. Cough is the most common side effect; angioedema is rare and may be potentially serious.

Breast feeding: Limited information. Do not use enalapril for the first few weeks of life, especially in the case of preterm infants because of risk of neonatal hypotension

Pregnancy Class D Use in second and third trimesters confers risk of oligohydramnios, and birth malformations.

Hepatic impairment: may need dose reduction, and close monitoring.

127Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

Renal impairment: may need dose reduction when creatinine clearance is less than &lt;30 ml/min (approximate serum creatinine 3 mg/dl), when dose should be 2.5 mg once a day. 13

13 US FDA full prescribing information for enalapril.

## Thiazide diuretics for use in hypertension with special focus on low dose hydrochlorothiazide:

They act by increasing sodium excretion. Thiazide diuretics are useful agents in the therapy of hypertension as first line drugs and as add on therapy when initial therapy with calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors does not achieve target for BP control. Benefits on cardiovascular outcomes have been proven for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. They are long acting agents effective as once a day therapy. In high doses(25 mg and above) thiazides have metabolic side effects like glucose intolerance, worsening of lipids, hypokalaemia, but given in low doses (12.5 mg) they exert near maximal lowering of BP without producing biochemical changes as noted above. Thiazide like agents like chlorthalidone, indapamide are also available, which are longer acting than hydrochlorothiazide, and have beneficial outcomes on cardiovascular mortality documented in clinical trials.

## Indications for thiazides:

Hypertension, Heart failure

Dose, titration, and use in combinations in hypertension

Dose in hypertension: 12. 5 mg once daily. Increasing the dose to 25 mg daily may not increase antihypertensive effect but can increase risk of hyperglycemia.

Low dose hydrochlorothiazide can be used in combination with calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors for treatment of hypertension. The combination of thiazide diuretics with beta-blockers is not preferred as it increases the risk of new onset diabetes as well has an adverse effect on lipids.

Contraindications: severe hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia.

Cautions

Thiazides can worsen glycemiccontrol and gout.

Side effects: Gastro-intestinal disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, altered plasma lipid concentration, metabolic and electrolyte disturbances (including hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypercalcaemia, hyperglycaemia). Occasional thrombocytopenia, impotence.

Pregnancy: Not used to treat hypertension in pregnancy. Administration in third trimester carries risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia.

Hepatic impairment: Avoid in severe liver disease; hypokalemia may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy

Renal impairment: Avoid if creatinine clearance is less than &lt;30 ml/min (approximate serum creatinine 3 mg/dl), when they may be ineffective.

## HYPERTENSION OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (BP)- patient information leaflet

## Why is high blood pressure called a silent killer?

In the past most illnesses made us feel unwell. We know we are ill because we get symptoms like diarrhoea or fever or cough. We see the doctor to get help. But when we have high blood pressure there are no symptoms for many years. It's like a silent killer who comes quietly behind you and stabs you. High BP slowly damages the important blood vessels in our body without us knowing it. Later wecan become suddenly very sick. Only then we know we had hypertension but it may be too late to treat it by then.

What is hypertension? The pressure of air in a bus tyre must not be too high or too low. If it is too high it may burst without warning. If the pressure of water in a hose is too high it may suddenly burst. In the same way our blood flows to different parts of the body in blood vessels. If the pressure in the blood vessels is too high the blood vessels will become damaged over time. We do not always know why some people get high blood pressure. In a few people there are reasons like kidney disease and alcohol overuse.

If hypertension causes no symptoms of disease at the start, how can we find hypertension early? The only way to check blood pressure is through blood pressure machines.

What is the normal blood pressure? Our heart is a pump that first fills with blood and then pumps it to the blood vessels. It then fills again and then pumps again. So blood pressure readings have 2 numbers. The first number or systolic BP is when the heart is pumping blood. The second number or

diastolic BP is when it is filling. The normal blood pressure is 130 systolic and 80 diastolic and we write that as 130/80. Readings lower than 130/80 can be normal. However the blood pressure of every person can vary from time to time. When we are exercising or worried it can increase. When we are resting it can be lower. So your blood pressure may need to be repeated s few times when you are resting if it was found to be high. Anyone who keeps having readings over 140/90 has high blood pressure.

What are the effects of high blood pressure on the body? If untreated high blood pressure damages the blood vessels to different parts of the body causing Braln Eyes

-  Strokes- we get sudden paralysis or numbness side of the body or speech which may not get Bloou
-  Heart attacks- sudden blockage of blood vessel the heart can cause severe chest pain and sudden death
-  Kidney failure
-  Damage to vision and many other problems
-  Sadly these problems may happen very suddenly without warning.

When should I have my blood pressure checked? You should check your blood pressure even if you feel well because in the early stages it causes no symptoms. All those over 18 years should have the blood pressure checked every 2 years. If you are overweight, have diabetes, do little exercise, smoke, drink alcohol, or have family members with high blood pressure you should have it checked once a year. Your health centre nurse or health worker can check your BP. You do not need to see a doctor to check BP.

If I have high blood pressure what can I do to help it myself? There are several things you can do

-  Stop smoking: smoking markedly increases the damage caused by high blood pressure.
-  If you already do not do hard work, do some exercise you enjoy doing that makes you a little short of breath for at least 30 minutes each day.
-  If you are overweight reducing your weight by even 5 kg over 6 months can lower blood pressure.
-  If you work hard and sweat a lot just avoid salty food. Otherwise reduce the salt you add in cooking by half.
-  Avoid fatty food like oils or oily fried food, fatty meat (take off the fat before you cook goat or take the skin off chicken). Eat more vegetables and fish.
-  Do not take excessive alcohol.
-  Don't drink more than 2 glasses of coffee each day.

Do I need to take tablets? How long will I need to take these tablets? People with high blood pressure of 160/100 or higher and those for whom changing lifestyle does not work need tablets to lower blood pressure. Disease like pneumonia, typhoid can be cured by taking tablets for only a limited time. But blood pressure tablets do not cure the disease but control it only as long as you take them. It's like dying your hair which has turned grey as you get older. It will become black only as long as you keep dying it black! You must keep taking the tablets regularly and not stop them without asking your doctor. Most tablets can be taken once a day either in the morning or night. It should become a routine like brushing your teeth. Make sure you get more tablets before your last lot run out. Remember that treating high BP will be one of the best things you can do to protect your health in the future. Treatment of hypertension may not help always make you feel better straight away.

Will the tablets cause harm? Blood pressure tablets are usually very safe. If you do get side effects there are many different medications to choose from and the doctor will find one that suits you. The doctor may ask you take other medicines like aspirin and some tablets to lower your blood cholesterol which is a chemical in blood that can worsen the effects of high blood pressure.

138Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary HypertensionFull Document

How often do I need to see the doctor? Till your blood pressure is controlled the doctor may see you once a month. Once the blood pressure is controlled you only need to see the doctor once in 6 months. Continue your medications and you can see the doctor at any time if you have any worries over your treatment. Remembertake your medications regularly. TOGETHER WE CAN STOP THE SILENT KILLER AND PREVENT UNNECESSARY SUDDEN DEATHS AND DISABILITY.

| 2.Rationale                       | Hypertension is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease depends on identification of people who are at risk before disease has become established. Formal cardiovascular risk assessment at the time of diagnosis allows a person's 10-year risk of cardiovascular events, such as coronary heart disease and stroke, to be estimated. Statin therapy is effective in further reducing acute cardiovascular events in people with hypertension. |

| 4.What Quality Measure means for each audience | Service providers ensure systems are in place for people aged under 80 years with treated hypertension to have a clinic blood pressure target set to below 140/90 mmHg, and for people aged 80 years and over with treated hypertension to have a clinic blood pressure target set to below 150/90 mmHg. Healthcare professionals ensure that people aged under 80 years with treated hypertension have a clinic blood pressure target set to below 140/90 mmHg, and people aged 80 years and over with treated hypertension have a clinic blood pressure target set to below 150/90 mmHg. Equality and diversity considerations : Target blood pressure stated may not be achievable in some patients because of sustainability or acceptability of required treatment and attempts to do so may result in default from any treatment. Patient centered care should be used to set target BP to that which is acceptable and sustainable for each individual. |
