## 1. Introduction

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Worldwide, one in 10 pregnancies is associated with diabetes, 90% of which are GDM. Undiagnosed or inadequately treated GDM can lead to significant maternal &amp; fetal complications. Moreover, women with GDM and their offsprings are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

In India, one of the most populous country globally, rates of GDM are estimated to be 10-14.3% which is much higher than the west. As of 2010, there were an estimated 22 million women with diabetes between the ages of 20 and 39 &amp; an additional 54 million women in this age group with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or pre-diabetes with the potential to develop GDM if they become pregnant. In a field study in Tamil Nadu performed under the Diabetes in Pregnancy - Awareness and Prevention project, of the 4151, 3960 and 3945 pregnant women screened in urban, semi urban and rural areas, respectively, the prevalence of GDM was 17.8% in the urban, 13.8% in the semi urban and 9.9% in the rural areas. The incidence of GDM is expected to increase to 20% i.e. one in every 5 pregnant women is likely to have GDM.

Despite a high prevalence of GDM in Indian women, currently screening of pregnant women for GDM is not being done universally as part of the essential antenatal package. The test is sporadically being done at DH and MC in some states as per direction of individual clinician except in the state of Tamil Nadu where every pregnant woman is being screened up to the level of PHC as a part of the government of Tamil Nadu initiative.

Despite the fact that GDM is a sizeable public health problem with serious adverse effects on mother &amp; child, we do not have a standard GoI guideline for diagnosis and management of GDM.

## 1.1 Consequences of GDM

Maternal risks of GDM include polyhydramnios, pre-eclampsia, prolonged labour, obstructed labour, caesarean section, uterine atony, postpartum haemorrhage, infection and progression of retinopathy which are the leading global causes of maternal mortality.

Fetal risks include spontaneous abortion, intra-uterine death, stillbirth, congenital malformation, shoulder dystocia, birth injuries, neonatal hypoglycaemia and infant respiratory distress syndrome. Immediate and long-term clinical effects of GDM are important contributors to the burden of non-communicable diseases in many countries.

| Maternal Risk | Maternal Risk          | Fetal | Risk                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| w             | Polyhydramnios         | w     | Spontaneous abortion                 |
| w             | Pre-eclampsia          | w     | Intra-uterine death                  |
| w             | Prolonged labour       | w     | Stillbirth                           |
| w             | Obstructed labour      | w     | Congenital malformation              |
| w             | Caesarean section      | w     | Shoulder dystocia                    |
| w             | Uterine atony          | w     | Birth injuries                       |
| w             | Postpartum haemorrhage | w     | Neonatal hypoglycaemia               |
| w             | Infection              | w     | Infant respiratory distress syndrome |

## 2. Evidence

## 2.1 International evidence

Review of international evidences shows definite guidelines for screening pregnant women for GDM. The American &amp; Canadian guidelines recommend universal screening by two step approach. This includes a screening with 50g one hour plasma glucose test (&gt;140 mg/dL taken as screen positive). The screen positive women are subjected to 100gm OGTT and those with 2 or more abnormal values of plasma glucose are diagnosed as GDM. The NICE &amp; Australian guidelines recommend a risk based screening with 75gm 2 hour OGTT with fasting blood glucose ≥ 126mg/dL &amp; 2hr ≥ 140 mg/dL taken as diagnostic for GDM. The WHO endorses universal screening for GDM at 24-28 weeks of gestation using the 75gm 2hr PG (cut offs fasting ≥ 126mg/dL &amp; ≥ 140mg/dL). Almost all guidelines agree to management of GDM using Medical Nutrition Therapy (Diet plan) &amp; insulin therapy if needed.

## 2.2 National evidence

The Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group in India endorses the single step test recommended by WHO for diagnosis of GDM using a 75gm OGTT irrespective of the last meal with a threshold value of 2 hour PG&gt;140 mg/dL. Tamil Nadu endorses universal screening of all pregnant women at 12-16 weeks gestation or at first antenatal visit. If the reports are normal, the next screening is done at 24-28 weeks gestation and later at 32-34 weeks. GDM is managed by MNT and Insulin therapy is added if required. In the postpartum period, 75gm OGTT is repeated at 6-12 weeks after delivery. If normal, OGTT is repeated at 6 months &amp; thereafter, every year after delivery.

## 2.3 Need for National guidelines

Considering the high prevalence of GDM in India and the maternal &amp; fetal morbidity associated with untreated or inappropriately managed GDM, there was an urgent need to formulate our own guidelines for testing all PW for GDM. Timely diagnosis of GDM will allow initiation of appropriate treatment to prevent &amp; minimise the ill effects of uncontrolled GDM on the mother &amp; child in the short term &amp; long term. For this reason, GoI constituted an expert group to deliberate on GDM in detail &amp; formulate guidelines for India.

The present guideline has been prepared based on the recommendations of the experts &amp; available national/international evidences.

## 3. Technical guidelines on testing &amp; management of GDM

## 3.1 Target population

All pregnant women in the community

## 3.2 Pre-requisites for testing &amp; management of GDM

- Availability of supply &amp; testing facility
- Trained human resources to manage the cases after diagnosis
- Appropriate referral linkages

## 3.3 Selection of facility

- States are free to choose the number of districts where the programme will be implemented
- Once a district is chosen, implementation of programme should be universal in that district from Medical College to sub-centre
- A health facility chosen for implementation of programme should have all the pre-requisites in place
- The service provider &amp; programme officer must be oriented and trained about the programme

## 3.4 Protocol for investigation

- Testing for GDM is recommended twice during ANC.
- The first testing should be done during first antenatal contact as early as possible in pregnancy.
- The second testing should be done during 24-28 weeks of pregnancy if the first test is negative.
- There should be at least 4 weeks gap between the two tests.
- The test is to be conducted for all PW even if she comes late in pregnancy for ANC at the time of first contact.
- If she presents beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy, only one test is to be done at the first point of contact.
- If the test is positive at any point, protocol of management should be followed as given in this guideline.
- At MC/DH/other CEmOC Centres, availability of glucometer must be ensured at all ANC clinics with facility for collection of sample and interpretation of result there itself (by training of personnel).
- At all other facilities upto PHC level, there should be an in-house arrangement for conducting the test &amp; giving report immediately so that necessary advice can be given on the same day by the treating doctor.

## 3.5 Methodology: Test for diagnosis

- Single step testing using 75 g oral glucose &amp; measuring plasma glucose 2 hour after ingestion.
- 75g glucose is to be given orally after dissolving in approximately 300ml water whether the PW comes in fasting or non-fasting state, irrespective of the last meal. The intake of the solution has to be completed within 5 min.

- A plasma standardised glucometer should be used to evaluate blood glucose 2 hours after the oral glucose load.
- If vomiting occurs within 30 min of oral glucose intake, the test has to be repeated the next day, if vomiting occurs after 30 minutes, the test continues.
- The threshold plasma glucose level of ≥ 140 mg/dL (more than or equal to 140) is taken as cut off for diagnosis of GDM.

## 3.6 Instrument used for diagnosis

- For this programme, it has been decided that a plasma calibrated glucometer should be used for diagnosis of GDM instead of a semiauto-analyser or auto-analyser or any other testing methodology as it may lead to delay in getting the results immediately.
- Since it will be difficult for PW to come another day just to collect the result, testing facility with a glucometer should be available at all facilities in the ANC clinic itself. This facilitates getting the result immediately so that necessary advice may be given the same day.
- A glucometer should also be available in the labour room for close monitoring of GDM cases during labour.
- Calibration of Glucometer recommended after 20 measurements using calibration test strips, provided with glucometers.
- Specification for the glucometer is given at Annexure 8
- Details on plasma calibration of glucometer is given in Annexure 9

## 3.7 Management of GDM

## Guiding Principles

- All PW who test positive for GDM for the first time should be started on Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for 2 weeks.
- After 2 weeks on MNT, a 2 hrs PPPG (post meal) should be done.

## Universal testing for GDM

- If 2hr PPPG &lt;120 mg/dL, repeat test every 2 weeks in second trimester &amp; every week in third trimester
- If 2hr PPPG ≥ 120mg/dL medical management (Insulin Therapy) to be started as per guidelines.

Thus, GDM is managed initially with MNT and if it is not controlled with MNT, insulin therapy is added to the MNT.

## Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)

## Principles of MNT

## w Healthy eating during pregnancy

All pregnant women with GDM should get Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) as soon as diagnosis is made. MNT for GDM primarily involves a carbohydrate controlled balanced meal plan which promotes

- Optimal nutrition for maternal and fetal health
- Adequate energy for appropriate gestational weight gain,
- Achievement and maintenance of normoglycemia
- w The importance of the individualised nutrition assessment in GDM

Nutrition assessment in GDM should be individualised to allow an accurate appraisal of the woman's nutritional status. This assessment includes defining her Body Mass Index (BMI) or percentage of desirable pre-pregnancy body weight and optimal pattern of weight gain during pregnancy.

## w Calories and GDM

- Individualisation is important when determining energy requirement, and adjustments should be made based on weight change patterns.
- Energy requirement during pregnancy includes the normal requirement of adult and an additional requirement for fetal growth plus the associate increase in the body weight of pregnant woman.

- Energy requirement does not increase in the first trimester unless a woman is underweight.
- Energy requirement increases during second and third trimester.
- Energy intake should be adequate enough to provide appropriate weight gain during pregnancy.
- As per Indian ICMR guidelines for an average weight gain of 1012 Kg, an addition of 350 K.cal/day above the adult requirement is recommended during second and third trimester.
- Equations proposed by ICMR (1989) expert group can be used to calculate adult energy requirement which are as follows:
- l Energy requirement (K.cal/d)= BMR ×PAL
- \*BMR= Basal metabolic rate

\*PAL= Physical activity level

- l BMR (K.cal/d)for adult females (18-30yrs)= 14×B.W (Kg) + 471
- l BMR (K.cal/d)for adult females (30-60yrs)= 8.3×B.W (Kg) + 788 \*B.W= body weight
- l Ideal body weight can be taken in to consideration when calculating the requirement.
- l PAL values proposed by ICMR expert group (2009) are as follows
- An addition of 350 k. cal can be made after calculating the energy requirement for adults as stated in above table.

| Level of activity | PAL value |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Sedentary work    | 1.53      |
| Moderate work     | 1.8       |
| Heavy work        | 2.3       |

## Example

How to determine calorie requirement of a 28 years of age sedentary active pregnant woman in second trimester with height=153 cm, current weight=60 Kg, and pre-pregnancy weight=54 Kg.

1. First calculate the BMI

BMI (kg/m2) = weight in Kg/Height in meter square

= 54/1.53\*1.53

= 23.06 Kg/m2

BMI is in normal range

2. Calculate BMR

- l

- BMR (K.cal/d)for adult females (18-30yrs) = 14×B.W(Kg) + 471

= 14 ×53+471

= 1213K.cal

3. Identify PAL

PAL of sedentary activity is 1.53

- 4.

- Total energy requirement of adult

= BMR×PAL

= 1213×1.53

= 1856K.cal

5. Total energy requirement in pregnancy = Total energy requirement of adult+350 Kcal/d

- =1856+350 = 2206 kcal per day

Maternal weight gain is the important measure in follow up visits to determine whether energy intake is adequate to support fetal growth. Weight gain targets for pregnancy are based on women's pre pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI).

| Pre-pregnancy weight                                    | BMI (kg/m 2 )      | Total weight gain range (kg) |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Normal weight                                           | 18.5 to 24.9       | 11.5 to 16 kg                |
| Under weight                                            | Less than 18.5     | 12.5 to 18 kg                |
| Over weight                                             | 25 to 29.9         | 7 to 11.5 kg                 |
| Obese (include all classes namely grade I, II, and III) | Equal/more than 30 | 5 to 9 kg                    |

\*Desirable weight calculated from the Ideal height/weight chart (Annexure 1)

- Hypocaloric diets in obese women with GDM can result in ketonemia and ketonuria. However, moderate caloric restriction (reduction by 30% of estimated energy needs) in obese women with GDM may improve glycemic control without ketonemia and reduce maternal weight gain.

## Select Carbohydrates Carefully

## Carbohydrate foods and daily intakes

- Carbohydrate foods are essential for a healthy diet of mother and baby. Once digested, carbohydrate foods are broken down to glucose which goes into blood stream. The type, amount and frequency of carbohydrate intake has a major influence on blood glucose readings.
- Foods sources of carbohydrate include cereals (wheat, bajra, ragi, corn rice etc.) and its products (suji, refined flour, breads, pasta, noodles etc), pulses (green gram, bengal gram, black gram etc.), starchy vegetables (potato, sweet potato, corn tapioca etc), fruits, sweets, juices etc.
- Large amounts of carbohydrate foods eaten at one time will lead to high blood glucose level and should be avoided.

- Spreading carbohydrate foods over the day will help to prevent this. It is better to spread carbohydrate foods over 3 small meals and 2-3 snacks each day than taking 3 large meals
- Complex carbohydrates ( like whole-grain cereals like oats, bajra, jowar, ragi, whole pulses, vegetables and fruits with skins ) should be preferred over simple carbohydrates like food with lots of added sugar or honey, or foods that are made from refined white flour. Some examples of simple carbohydrates include sweets, cakes, puddings, sweet biscuits, pastry, juice, soft drinks, chips, white bread, naan, pizza etc
- Counting the number of carbohydrate serves that a mother eats during the day will help her to eat the right amount of carbohydrate. As a guide, aim should be for 2-3 carbohydrate serves at each major meal and 1-2 carbohydrate serves at each snack.
- One serve = approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate. Exchange list for carbohydrate is given in annexure 3

## Understanding Fat Intake during Pregnancy

Saturated fat intake (sources - ghee, butter, coconut oil, palm oil, red meat, organ meat, full cream milk etc) should be less than 10 % of total calories and dietary cholesterol should be less than 300mg/d. In obese and overweight patients, a lower-fat diet overall can help slow the rate of weight gain.

## Ways to trim the fat from your diet

- Use less fat in cooking and avoid frying of foods
- Using to low-fat dairy products in place of whole milk or full cream products.
- Choosing low fat snacks like substituting fresh fruit for high-fat snacks such as cakes, biscuits, chocolates and pastries.
- Using lean meat in place of red meat

Protein: Protein requirement in pregnancy is increased (additional 23 g/d) to allow for fetal growth. At least 3 serving of protein foods are required every day to meet the increased demand. Sources of protein are milk and milk products, egg, fish, chicken, pulses (dal), nuts etc

Fiber: High fibre foods especially soluble fibre may help control blood sugar by delaying gastric emptying, retarding the entry of glucose into the bloodstream and lessening the postprandial rise in blood glucose. Soluble fibre in flax seed, psyllium husk, oat bran, legumes (dried beans of all kinds, peas and lentils), and pectin (from fruit, such as apples) and forms in root vegetables (such as carrots) are helpful.

## Management of Pregnant Woman with GDM

National Guidelines for Diagnosis &amp; Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus

13

## Medical Management (Insulin Therapy)

- Insulin therapy is the accepted medical management of PW with GDM not controlled on MNT in 2 weeks..
- Oral tablets for diabetes treatment in pregnancy- not to be given as they are not safe
- All PW in whom MNT fails to achieve a 2 hr PPG &lt;120 mg/dL are started on insulin, along with MNT.
- At PHC, MO should initiate treatment &amp; refer PW with GDM to a higher centre if plasma glucose levels are not controlled or there is some other complication.
- At CHC/DH/MC, a Specialist/Gynaecologist/Physician/MO can start Insulin
- Any PW on insulin therapy should be instructed to keep sugar/jaggery/ glucose powder handy at home to treat hypoglycemia if it occurs

## Very high 2 hr PPPG:

- If 2hr PPPG is &gt;200mg/dL at diagnosis, starting dose of insulin should be 8 units pre-mixed insulin.
- The dose to be adjusted on follow-up and at the same time MNT has to be followed. Frequency of monitoring to be decided by the treating Physician/Gynaecologist/MO.
- If PW requires more than 20 units insulin/day, she should be referred to higher health-care centre.
- The dose of insulin should be followed as per the flow chart given on page 18.

## Site of Insulin Injection:

- Front/Lateral aspect of the thigh or over abdomen
- Insulin injection is to be given subcutaneously only.

## Insulin Injection Sites

## Details of Insulin injection &amp; Syringe

- Only Injection Human premix insulin 30/70 is to be administered
- Insulin syringe - 40 IU syringe is to be used
- Insulin vial - 40 IU/mL is to be used

## Storage of insulin vial &amp; syringe:

- Insulin vials have to be made available along with disposable syringe to the PW for use.
- Appropriate arrangement should be made for storage of insulin in refrigerators at 4 0 -8 0 C (in the door of the refrigerator) and battery backup in areas with an erratic supply of electricity. Vial should never be kept in freezer compartment of refrigerators. If by mistake, vials are stored in freezer and frozen, they should be not be used at all and discarded
- At PHCs, stock of insulin vials should be stored in refrigerators.
- Insulin vials should not be exposed to direct heat/sunlight, and are stable up to 25 0 -30 0 C
- Open insulin vials (in current use) should be stored in refrigerator or in dark and cool place. If refrigerator is not available, the vial should be kept in earthen pots filled in water or kept in cool place (near drinking water storage).
- Once opened, an insulin vial should be used within one month. If not used within one month, it should not be used and discarded.

## Insulin syringe

- Single insulin syringe can be used safely for 14 injections if capped &amp; stored properly.
- Before use, check syringe every time whether needle is straight or not
- Never clean needle with spirit or any other disinfectant. It will make needle blunt
- Tip of needle should not come in contact with anything else except cleaned skin
- After use, place the cap over needle carefully without touching the tip of needle
- Syringe in use can be stored at room temperature without direct exposure to sunlight or heat. There is no need to store in refrigerator.
- Proper disposal of syringe should be taught to the PW.

## Disposal of syringe

- (i) Disposal of home used syringes:
- Syringe with needle should be discarded if tip is blunt, bent, causing pain or has been used for 14 injections.
- This syringe should not be used by any other person or PW.
- Recap syringe and place the entire syringe with needle in an opaque plastic bottle with a screw cap or a plastic or metal box that closes tightly. Carry it to hospital on next visit where it can be given to the staff for disposal.
- The disposal after recommended number of syringe use:
- l At home, the used syringe should be either burnt or buried far away from reach of children
- l Or the PW should carry the used syringe to the health facility for the waste management
- Never throw used syringe in dustbin

## (ii) Waste management including syringe disposal at health facility

Syringes causes the most injuries to the health care providers at all levels. The following safety guideline should be followed when handling sharp instruments such as needles and syringes:

- Sharp instruments should never be passed from one hand to other hand directly
- After use, syringes should be decontaminated by flushing them with a 0.5% chlorine solution three times for ten minutes

Insulin Therapy

- All syringes/needles should be handled properly and disposed in puncture proof container
- Needles should be destroyed immediately using hub-cutter
- Sharps should be disposed immediately in a puncture resistant container. Needles should not be recapped, bent or broken or disassembled before disposal
- The used needles/syringes once decontaminated and destroyed using hub-cutter should be placed in the red bag and bag should be sealed labelled and audited before disposal
- All sharps including needles once processed as above should be disposed of in the sharps pit located at the health facility

## Refer to higher centre if one or more of the following conditions are met:

- Nausea &amp; vomiting and not able to take food orally
- Fasting blood glucose &gt;200mg/dL with or without insulin
- Fasting blood glucose &gt;150 mg/dL or post breakfast&gt;250 mg/dL even after giving insulin is uniformly required.
- Total dose of insulin (combined morning and evening dose) on each day exceeds 20 units
- If pregnant women develops low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) more than once in a day.
- If pregnant woman refuses to take insulin injection

## How to Recognise &amp; Manage Hypoglycemia

- w Any PW on insulin can develop hypoglycaemia at any time
- w Hypoglycemia is diagnosed when blood glucose level is &lt; 70 mg/dl.
- w Important to recognise symptoms of hypoglycaemia &amp; treat immediately

## How to recognise hypoglycaemia?

- w Early symptoms T remors of hands, sweating, palpitations, hunger, easy fatigability, headache, mood changes, irritability, low attentiveness, tingling sensation around the mouth/lips or any other abnormal feeling
- w Severe Confusion, abnormal behaviour or both, visual disturbances, nervousness or anxiety, abnormal behaviour.
- w Uncommon Seizures and loss of consciousness

## How to manage hypoglycaemia?

- w Ask PW to take 3 TSF of glucose powder (15-20 grams) dissolved in a glass of water
- w After taking oral glucose, she must take rest &amp; avoid any physical activity
- w 15 minutes after taking glucose, she must eat one chapati with vegetable/rice/one glass of milk/idli/fruits/anything eatable which is available
- w If hypoglycemia continues, repeat same amount of glucose and wait
- w If glucose is not available, take one of the following: Sugar - 6 TSF in a glass of water/fruit juice/honey/anything which is sweet/any food
- w Take rest, eat regularly and check blood glucose if possible
- w If PW develops &gt;1 episode of hypoglycemia in a day, she should consult any doctor immediately

## 3.8 Special obstetric care for PW with GDM

## Antenatal care

- Antenatal care of a PW with GDM should be provided by gynaecologist if available.
- In cases diagnosed before 20 weeks of pregnancy, a fetal anatomical survey by USG should be performed at 18-20 weeks.
- For all pregnancies with GDM, a fetal growth scan should be performed at 28-30 weeks gestation &amp; repeated at 34-36 weeks gestation. There should be at least 3 weeks gap between the two ultrasounds and it should include fetal biometry &amp; amniotic fluid estimation.
- PW with GDM in whom blood glucose level is well controlled &amp; there are no complications, should go for routine antenatal care as per GoI guidelines.
- In PW with GDM having uncontrolled blood glucose level or any other complication of pregnancy, the frequency of antenatal visits should be increased to every 2 weeks in second trimester &amp; every week in third trimester.
- Monitor for abnormal fetal growth (macrosomia/growth restriction) and polyhydramnios at each ANC visit
- PW with GDM to be diligently monitored for hypertension in pregnancy, proteinuria and other obstetric complications
- In PW with GDM between 24-34 weeks of gestation and requiring early delivery, antenatal steroids should be given as per GoI guidelines i.e. Inj. Dexamethasone 6 mg IM 12 hourly for 2 days. More vigilant monitoring of blood glucose levels should be done for next 72 hours following injection. In case of raised blood glucose levels during this period, adjustment of insulin dose should be made accordingly.

## Fetal surveillance in PW with GDM:

- PW with GDM are at an increased risk for fetal death in utero and this risk is increased in PW requiring medical management. Hence vigilant fetal surveillance is required.
- Fetal heart should be monitored by auscultation on each antenatal visit.

PW should be explained about Daily Fetal Activity Assessment. One simple method is to ask her to lie down on her side after a meal and note how long it takes for the foetus to kick 10 times. If the foetus does not kick 10 times within 2 hrs, she should immediately consult a health care worker and if required should be referred to a higher centre for further evaluation.

## Labour &amp; Delivery

- PW with GDM with good control of Blood glucose (2 hr PPPG &lt; 120 mg/dl) levels may be delivered at their respective health facility.
- PW with GDM on insulin therapy with uncontrolled blood glucose levels (2 hr PPPG ≥ 120 mg/dl) or insulin requirement &gt;20 U/day should be referred for delivery at CEmOC centres under care of gynaecologist at least a week before the planned delivery.
- Such referred cases must get assured indoor admission or can be kept in a birth waiting home with round the clock availability of medical staff for monitoring.
- Timing of delivery: GDM pregnancies are associated with delay in lung maturity of the fetus; so routine delivery prior to 39 weeks is not recommended.
- If a PW with GDM with well controlled plasma glucose has not already delivered spontaneously, induction of labour should be scheduled at or after 39 weeks pregnancy.
- In PW with GDM with poor plasma glucose control, those with risk factors like hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, previous still birth &amp; other complications should be delivered earlier. The timing of delivery should be individualised by the obstetrician accordingly.
- Vaginal delivery should be preferred and LSCS should be done for obstetric indications only.
- In case of fetal macrosomia (estimated fetal weight &gt; 4 Kg) consideration should be given for a primary cesarean section at 39 weeks to avoid shoulder dystocia.

## Special precaution during labour

- PW with GDM on Insulin require plasma glucose monitoring during labour by a glucometer.
- The morning dose of Insulin is withheld on the day of induction/labour and the PW should be started on 2 hourly monitoring of plasma glucose.
- IV infusion with normal saline (NS) to be started &amp; regular insulin to be added according to blood glucose levels as per the Table below.

| Blood glucose level | Amount of Insulin added in 500 ml NS | Rate of NS Infusion      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 90-120 mg/dl        | 0                                    | 100 ml/hr (16 drops/min) |
| 120-140 mg/dl       | 4 U                                  | 100 ml/hr (16 drops/min) |
| 140-180 mg/dl       | 6 U                                  | 100 ml/hr (16 drops/min) |
| >180 mg/dl          | 8 U                                  | 100 ml/hr (16 drops/min) |

## 3.9 Immediate neonatal care for baby of mother with GDM

- All neonates should receive immediately essential newborn care with emphasis with early breastfeeding to prevent hypoglycemia.
- If required, the sick neonates should be immediately resuscitated as per GoI guidelines.
- Newborn should be monitored for hypoglycemia (capillary blood glucose &lt;44 mg/dl). Monitoring should be started at 1 hour of delivery and continued every 4 hours (prior to next feed) till four stable glucose values are obtained.
- Neonate should be also be evaluated for other neonatal complications like respiratory distress, convulsions, hyperbilirubinemia.

## 3.9.1 Hypoglycemia in a newborn with GDM mother

All babies born to mothers with GDM are at risk for development of hypoglycemia irrespective of treatment whether they are on insulin or not and should be observed closely. All babies of GDM mother should be checked for hypoglycemia at or within one hour of delivery by glucoemeter.

## Diagnosis of hypoglycemia

The operational definition cut off of plasma glucose by glucometer is 45 mg/dl. Any new-born with blood glucose lees than 45 mg/dL should be considered as 'baby with hypoglycemia'.

The glucometers are not very reliable for diagnosis of hypoglycemia as their sensitivity decreases at lower blood glucose range. The most definite diagnosis of hypoglycemia is by measurement of blood glucose by established laboratory methods (glucose oxidase method by

calorimetric). In view of non-availability of laboratory facilities at all places and time delay in getting result, plasma glucose values obtained by glucometers will be considered for all operational steps. Where ever lab facilities are available, treating physician can take a decision to send a blood glucose sample to the lab without delaying next management step.

## Symptoms of hypoglycemia

Most of the time, new-born baby may not have any symptom of hypoglycemia at all. Symptoms of hypoglycemia are very variable and seen only in a smaller proportion of patients. A physician should observe for following sign in a new-born child for hypoglycemia:

- Stupor or Apathy
- Jitteriness or tremors
- Episodes of cyanosis
- Convulsions
- Intermittent apnoeic spells or tachypnea
- Weak and high pitched cry, limpness and lethargy
- Difficulty in feeding
- Eye rolling
- Episodes of sweating
- Any unexplained clinical feature in baby of diabetic mother

## Management of hypoglycemia

All cases of hypoglycemia should be managed in following manner:

| Step 1: | Whenever there is suspicion of hypoglycemia BG should be checked immediately with glucometer. In all babies born to diabetic mother, BG should be checked by glucometer between 1-2 hours after birth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 2: | If plasma glucose values is <45 mg/dl, this should be considered as 'hypoglycemia', move to next step                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Step 3: | New-born with hypoglycemia - immediately ask mother to give breast feed without any delay. Direct breast feeding is the best management step for neonatal hypoglycemia. If the infant is unable to suck, expressed breast milk from mother should be given. If mother is not in a position to give breast feed or no breast milk secretion/production, baby should be given any formula feed. One of the good options is to dissolve oneTSF of table sugar in 100 ml of normal cow's milk and give. |
| Step 4: | Once feed has been given, check blood glucose again after one hour. If blood glucose is >45 mg/dl, 2 hourly feeding (breast feeding is the best option but if not available, formula feed can be given) should be ensured by explaining to mother/relatives and supervised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Step 5: | If at any time plasma glucose by glucometer is <20 mg/dl, give immediate intravenous bolus injection of 10% dextrose 2 ml/kg body weight of baby.This should be followed by intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose at a rate of 100ml/kg/day.Blood glucose should be checked30 minutes after starting the infusion. If it is still less than 20 mg/dl, infant should be referred to higher centre where paediatrician is available.                                                                   |

## Signs of danger: Refer to higher centre

If any of the following sign/reports are observed, infant should be referred to higher centre with 10% dextrose IV infusion drip (100 ml/kg/day)

- Two values of plasma glucose &lt;20 mg/dL in spite of starting 10% dextrose IV infusion
- Occurrence of seizures
- Baby is not able to suck at repeated attempts and blood glucose is &lt;20 mg/dl
- Failure to maintain IV line and blood glucose is &lt;20 mg/dl

## Procedure for capillary blood glucose testing

A blood sample obtained from a heel puncture is useful and simple way of collecting blood sample from newborns and is recommended for blood glucose testing. The procedure is not without risk and might cause increased pain in newborns, local trauma, damage to nerves, blood vessels and bones, excessive blood loss and infection. So, It should be performed by a trained health care personnel, preferably by a paediatrician.

## Preparation :

Gather the following equipments:

- Gloves
- Cotton wool
- Capillary tube/and or blood bottle
- Clean tray to hold equipments
- Sharps disposal box

## Procedure:

- Wash hands and wear gloves
- Select the heel site for puncture
- The back of the heel should be avoided
- The site chosen for the sampling should be free from previous injury
- Ensure baby is lying in a safe and secure place

- Hold the baby's heel
- Hold the ankle with index and middle finger
- Use other fingers to steady the baby's leg
- Partly encircle the baby's heel with thumb
- Clean the proposed puncture site with disinfectant
- Allow the area to dry
- Gently compress the heel and hold the skin under tension
- Puncture the skin in a steady manner
- Relax the tension and wipe away the initial blood flow with cotton
- Whilst maintain the grip hold the heel so that blood is allowed to come out
- Gently but firmly press the baby's heel to form a large droplet of blood
- Do not squeeze
- Hold the capillary tube or blood bottle to the blood droplet and touch
- Momentarily release the pressure to collect subsequent blood then reapply pressure allowing the blood to flow
- Continue until sufficient blood has been obtained
- Once the sample has been obtained apply pressure to the site with gauze, maintain the pressure until bleeding has stopped
- Use the hypoallergenic tape
- Baby should be kept comfortable and handed to mother
- Equipments should be disposed
- The staff doing the puncture should wash hands after the procedure
- The sample should be sent for analysis as soon as possible.

## 3.10 Post-delivery follow up of PW with GDM

- Immediate postpartum care women with GDM is not different from women without GDM but these women are at high risk to develop Type 2 Diabetes mellitus in future.
- Maternal glucose levels usually return to normal after delivery. Nevertheless, a FPG &amp; 2 hr PPPG is performed on the 3rd day of delivery at the place of delivery. For this reason, GDM cases are not discharged after 48 hours unlike other normal PNC cases.
- Subsequently, ANM to perform 75 g GTT at 6 weeks postpartum to evaluate glycemic status of woman. Cut offs for normal blood glucose values are:
- l Fasting plasma glucose: ≥ 126 mg/dl
- l 75 g OGTT 2 hour plasma glucose
- v Normal: &lt; 140 mg/dl
- v IGT: 140-199mg/dl
- v Diabetes: ≥ 200 mg/dl
- w Test normal: Woman is counselled about lifestyle modifications, weight monitoring &amp; exercise.
- w Test positive: Woman advised to consult a physician.
- w PW with GDM and their offsprings are at increased risk of developing Type II Diabetes mellitus in later life. They should be counselled for healthy lifestyle and behaviour, particularly role of diet &amp; exercise.
- w GDM should be a part of NCD programme.

30

## 3.11 Pre-conception care &amp; counselling

- Woman with h/o GDM to be counselled about BMI &amp; Plasma glucose estimation before next pregnancy
- Desired Plasma glucose levels:
- l FPG - &lt;100 mg/dl
- l 2 hr PPPG - &lt;140 mg/dl
- Appropriate antihypertensive to be started if needed
- Counselled to consult Gynaecologist as soon as she misses her period

## Counselling tips:

- w Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can be easily controlled by diet (MNT) and exercise
- w Only in few women in whom blood glucose is not controlled by diet, insulin injections are required
- w Insulin injections are required only during pregnancy. Insulin will be stopped in most of the cases after pregnancy.
- w GDM can not be treated with oral tablets as they may harm the fetus.
- w If you are injecting insulin over abdomen, it can not reach your baby in any condition. Injecting insulin over abdomen is 100% safe.
- w Modification of diet is very easy and will not cost more. Sweets should be avoided at all times during pregnancy
- w If blood glucose is controlled, you and your baby both are safe and healthy
- w If blood glucose is not properly monitored, it may harm to both you and baby
- w If you are taking insulin, always keep glucose, sugar with you.
- w Pregnant women with GDM should deliver at health facilities. It will help in management of any complications which can be countered during delivery.

- i. Plasma calibrated Glucometers
- ii. Glucometer strips
- iii. Insulin syringe: 40 IU
- Drugs:

- i. Insulin: pre-mixed 30:70 &amp; regular

## Stationery:

- i. Monthly GDM Reporting format for State &amp; District Programme managers (Annexure 4)
- ii. Monthly GDM Reporting Format for Health Facility (Annexure 5)
- iii. Migration form for PW with GDM (Annexure 6)
- iv. Referral slip (Annexure 7)

## Case Load for GDM program:

- a. Nearly 14% of ANC screened pregnant women may be tested positive for GDM.
- b. Around 3% of these women may need insulin therapy.

## Budget estimates and provision for following needs to be done by the state/district programme officer:

## 1 (a) Insulin: Human Premix insulin 30/70

## (b) Insulin syringe

- i. On an average one woman may need 5 units of insulin per day and initial estimation for 180 days needs to be done.
- ii. Thus one woman will need average 900 units of insulin during her treatment of 180 days, this amount to an average 9 vials of insulin per woman.
- iii. One syringe can be used for 10 days. Thus each woman will need 18 insulin syringes during her treatment of 180 days.

## 2 (a) Glucometer

- i. Availability of glucometer is to be ensured at all such centres where GDM is being implemented
- ii. Before procuring new equipment, availability of existing glucometer through regular programme or under NCD needs to be accounted for.
- iii. No separate budget for sub centre may be required since untied funds can be utilised for this
- iv. Even at higher facility the untied funds can be utilised since the cost of device is not high
- v. MCH L2 level centres should have 2 glucometers. One to be kept in Labour room and another in lab/ANC room for testing blood sugar during ANC.
- vi. MCH L3 level centres including Medical Colleges should have 3 glucometers. One to be kept in Labour room, another in lab/ANC room for testing blood sugar during ANC. One standby glucometer is suggested to be kept in the equipment store for use due to any exigency like currently used glucometer becoming non-functional.

## vii. Sub health centres (MCH L1) needs to have one Glucometer.

## (b) Testing strips for Glucometer

- i. It is estimated that each PW will be tested twice during the ANC period for diagnosis of GDM.
- ii. The PW on MNT will require Fasting and Post-Prandial Blood sugar estimation every month. Thus each such PW will require 2 strips per month i.e 16 strips for the 6 months of treatment.
- iii. The PW on Insulin will require Fasting and Post-Prandial Blood sugar estimation every 15 days. Thus each PW will require 4 strips per month i.e 24 strips for the 6 months of treatment.
- iv. Strips can be purchased either from state/regular PIP budget or JSSK diagnostic funds

## 3. Glucose pouch

- i. Ideally state should procure 75 gm glucose pouch
- ii. It is estimated that each PW will be tested twice during the ANC period for diagnosis of GDM.
- iii. The PW on Insulin will require Fasting and Post Prandial Blood sugar estimation every 15 days. Thus each PW will require 4 glucose pouch per month, i.e. 24 glucose pouch for the 6 months of treatment.

## 4. Training:

- i. A 3 days training will be organised for GDM programme in every District
- ii. 1st Day: All participants (Programme managers/ANM/SN/LHV/ LT/MO/ObGyn) will attend
- iii. 2nd Day: Only ANM/SN/LHV/LT/MO/ObGyn will attend
- iv. 3rd Day: Only MO/ObGyn will attend

Note: \*\*\* TA to be given as per state Norms.

- The state need to adjust the training norms as per the training load of the district and state.

## Note:

Every district programme officer needs to undertake advanced planning and budget estimates for universal screening of GDM in the district

State programme officer needs to reflect the budgetary requirement either in the state/NHM PIP

Necessary equipments/supplies either cash or in kind needs to be made available in advance to all the health facilities in the district.

Similarly training institutes also needs to be provided the training budget as per the estimates in advance

Any procurement should be done through competitive and transparent bidding.

Certification of manufacturer for meeting the requirement of specifications and variations, if any by comparing the results from a regularly calibrated auto analyser for precision and accuracy needs to be clearly mentioned for glucometer supplied

Process of calibration and standardisation of glucometer also needs to be mentioned in manufacturer certificate

Wherever applicable AMC should be in built against all major procurements

## Annexure 2: MNT &amp; Sample diet chart

## The meal plan composition:

- The recommended composition of the GDM mother diet is~50%60% calories from carbohydrate, 10-20% from protein, 25-30% from fat.
- The distribution of calories, particularly carbohydrate, makes a difference in the postprandial blood sugars. The total intake of carbohydrate should be controlled and monitored and carbohydrate foods with a lower glycemic index should be emphasised.

## Important tips for planning meals for GDM mother

- A mother should follow discipline regarding meal timings. Eating heavy at one meal or skipping any meal or fasting for long hours should be avoided. She should include all food groups in her daily diet i.e cereal, pulses, milk and milk products, fruits, vegetable, and fats. For non- vegetarian mothers eggs, low fat meat like well- cooked fish or chicken can be included. Meal plan should be divided in to 3 major meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and 2-3 mid-day snack.

## Breakfast

- A pregnant woman should start her day with a healthy breakfast. She should never skip her breakfast. Breakfast should consist of 1-2 carbohydrate servings (like chapati/dalia/sandwich/poha/idli etc) as mentioned in exchange list along with one serving from protein rich foods (like milk/curd/paneer/egg etc.)

## Lunch/dinner

- In lunch and dinner the thali/plate can be divided in two halves
- Fill the first ½ with vegetables like bottle gourd, ridge gourd, lettuce, broccoli, spinach, carrots, green beans, tomatoes, celery, cabbage,
- mushrooms etc. as vegetable provide fibre which helps in controlling post prandial glucose level.
- The remaining half should be divided into two equal ¼ th parts.
- The ¼ portion of the plate can be filled with protein rich food like dal, soy nuggets, tofu, eggs, paneer, chicken, fish etc
- The remaining ¼ can be filled with chapati, brown rice, bread, cereals etc.
- Mother should have at least 1 serving of low fat, sugar-free yoghurt, curd or milk.
- It is also important for a mother to have at least 1 serving of fruits like guava, apple, berries or any citrus fruits.

- Carbohydrate serving in lunch and dinner should be between 2 to 3. Taking heavy meals should be avoided.
- Skipping lunch and dinner and taking meal at irregular time should be avoided.

## Mid day snack

- Along with major meals a pregnant woman should consume at least 2-3 healthy mid-day snacks.
- One to two carbohydrate serving can be taken in mid-day snack.
- A mother should maintain 2-3 hour gap with major meal when taking mid-day snack.
- Eating fried foods or junk foods or food with high amount of free sugars should be avoided.
- Some options for snack could be murmura chat, sprouts, vegetable dalia, vegetable poha, idli, vegetable uttapam, besan chilla with low amount of oil etc.

## General tips

- Fried foods should be avoided rather mother should steam, boil or sauté food in a non-stick pan.
- Whole fruits should be preferred over juices
- Prefer fish or chicken over red or organ meat.
- Fiber should be increased in the diet by including salad, beans, nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruit, whole grain cereals, whole pulses.
- A mother should drink water, buttermilk, soups, soy milk and other unsweetened healthy beverages instead of soda or fruit juices.

## Sample Meal plan

Sample meal pattern for pregnant woman are planned using cup measures. 1 cup measure and equivalents are as follows

1cup= 240 ml (8 oz or 227 gm) = 16 table spoon=48 tea spoon

½ cup= 120 ml (4oz or 113 gm) =8 table spoon=24 tea spoon

1/3 cup= 80 ml (2.6 oz. or 76 gm) =5 table spoon= 16 tea spoon

¼ cup=60 ml (2 oz. or 57 gm) = 4 table spoon= 12 tea spoon

1 table spoon = 3 tea spoon

1 tea spoon = 5ml
