Tobacco: A Public Health Problem

## Management of Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer

When managed with non-curative intent, intermediate-risk prostate cancer is associated with 10-year and 15-year Prostate cancer specific mortality rates rate of 13.0% and 19.6%, respectively [105]

Active surveillance in favorable intermediate risk patients can be an option as explained earlier. (weak recommendation). Criteria for active surveillance - Intermediate risk ISUP grade 2 (GS -3+4) with PSA &lt; 10ng/ml and low core positivity.

## Surgical management of intermediate risk:

These patients should be managed with RRP with bilateral eLND (if risk for pN+ exceeds 5%)

Ideal: A minimal invasive technique of RRP by robotics is preferred approach.

Essential: Open/laparoscopic RP with bilateral eLND can be performed with equally comparable outcomes.

## Summary of evidence for surgery in intermediate risk prostate cancer

Surgery: Two RCTs [106, 107] had showed survival benefit in favor of RRP when RRP vs. WW was compared in localised PCa. The risk of having positive LNs in intermediate-risk PCa is between 3.720.1% [108]. An eLND should be performed in intermediate-risk PCa if the estimated risk for pN+ exceeds 5% or 7% if using the nomogram by Gandaglia et al., which incorporates MRI-guided biopsies. One should offer RRP to patients with intermediate-risk PCa having life expectancy of &gt; 10 years. The nerve-sparing surgery should be offered to patients with a low risk of extracapsular disease (based on cT stage, ISUP grade, nomogram, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging).

## Non-surgical management:

Ideal: 4 - 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (neo-adjuvant and concurrent) with intensity modulated radiation therapy to a dose of 76 - 78 Gy in conventional fractionation or equivalent doses in moderate hypo-fractionation (Eg: 60 Gy/ 20 fractions over 4 weeks) (Level 1)

Essential: 4 - 6 months' androgen deprivation therapy or orchidectomy (after explaining side effects to patients) with radiation therapy up to a dose of 70 Gy which may include brachytherapy boost after 45 - 50 Gy of pelvic radiotherapy

## Summary of evidence for non-surgical management in intermediate risk prostate cancer

Radiotherapy - Patients suitable for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) should be considered for combined

Cancer Research in ICMR Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer radiotherapy with external beam radiation (IMRT if feasible; 76-78 Gy conventional fractionation or equivalent doses Eg - 60Gy/20# in 4 weeks by moderate hypo-fractionation) with short-term ADT (4-6 months) [109 - 112]. For patients where in risk of radiation toxicity is expected to be higher a lower dose of 70 Gy may be considered [109]. For patients unsuitable for ADT (e.g., due to co-morbidities) or unwilling to accept ADT (e.g. to preserve their sexual health) the recommended treatment is IMRT (76-78 Gy or equivalent doses E.g - 60Gy/20# in 4 weeks) [113, 114].

of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya. Role of SABR in intermediate risk disease: Based on early results of randomized controlled trials, SABR appears well tolerated as well as equally effective in intermediate risk prostate cancer [115, 116]. Data on role of ADT with SABR is lacking. SABR should not be standard of care in intermediate risk patients till mature data (10-year and 15-year survival data becomes available)

Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in Role of brachytherapy in intermediate risk disease: Brachytherapy boost after external beam radiation along with ADT has been shown to improve biochemical progression free survival without improvement in overall survival. The risks and benefits of brachytherapy boost have to be discussed with patients and may be considered in fit patients with minimal co-morbidities [117, 118]

childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.1% in Meghalaya to 4.4% in Delhi.

Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females

respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.1% in Meghalaya to 4.4% in Delhi.

Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 sub areas

(districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya.

The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Nagaland,

Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, males in

Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/100,000 for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus (in both males

and females) and cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx in males. Nonetheless, the states of the North

East had already reported high incidence rates of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract that would include anatomical sites such as, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, oesophagus

and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter

8. reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district)

and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly oesophagus, hypopharynx and larynx.

The details of individual registry write-up including that of Patiala, Naharlagun and Pasighat PBCRs were provided at the end of the report.

Quality of Data

The authenticity of the data depends on its quality and the completeness of coverage of cancer cases in the geographical area (quantity) and timeliness in data abstraction and is comprehensively covered in

Chapter 9. This chapter along with Chapter 5 that addressed the most valid basis of diagnosis of cancer and Chapter 6 dealing with mortality data show the challenges and limitations of cancer registration

in the Indian context vis-à-vis International comparisons. Every effort was made by both the individual

PBCRs and the coordinators at NCDIR to ensure that the data reported was as correct and as complete as possible. In more recent years the PBCR software applications programme has greatly helped in

enhancing the speed of data submission and its quality.

Use of Electronic Information Technology

Software programmes developed in-house have to a great extent contributed to improving the quality and coverage. Data that is keyed is checked as per international norms. In terms of completeness of coverage

a new feature in the software monitors the data received from different sources of a particular registry and

## Management of High Risk Prostate Cancer

## Management of high risk disease

When managed with non-curative intent, high-risk prostate cancer is associated with 10-year and 15-year Prostate cancer specific mortality rates of 28.8 and 35.5%, respectively [119]

## Surgical management of high risk prostate cancer

Surgery: RRP is a reasonable option for high risk disease. An eLND should be performed bilaterally. In follow up, patients may require multimodal treatment (ADT and/or RT) [120 - 122].

## Adjuvant treatment after surgery:

After surgery, early salvage radiotherapy is preferred with regular PSA follow up. The threshold for salvage radiotherapy should be kept low i.e. PSA ≥ 0·1 ng/mL or three consecutive rises (Level 1). Adjuvant radiotherapy may be preferred if all three risk factors are present (Positive margins, extracapsular invasion and seminal vesicle invasion) (Level 1).

## Summary of evidence for adjuvant treatment after surgery

Adjuvant RT Vs Salvage RT after prostatectomy: Based on earlier evidence [123 - 125], adjuvant radiotherapy to prostate bed +/- pelvic lymph nodes was delivered in patients with positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion and extracapsular extension. A dose of 64 - 66 Gy was delivered by external beam radiotherapy. But the trials that contributed to this practice were from pre ultra-sensitive PSA assays. A recently published prospectively designed meta-analysis including the RADICALS-RT (time free of metastases), GETUG-AFU 17 (event-free survival), and RAVES (biochemical progression) trials stated that adjuvant radiotherapy does not improve event-free survival in men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer and until data on long-term outcomes are available, early salvage treatment with radiotherapy to a dose of 64 - 66 Gy would seem the preferable treatment policy as it offers the opportunity to spare many men radiotherapy and its associated side-effects. 1 - 2 doses of GnRH antagonists may also be considered with salvage radiotherapy [125]. The threshold for early salvage RT must be low (Serum PSA 0.1 - 0.2 ng/mL)

## Criteria for failure/recurrence after surgery

Serum PSA of more than 0.2 ng/mL that is confirmed by a second determination of more than 0.2 ng/ mL after radical prostatectomy.

## Non-surgical management

Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were Ideal: 2 - 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy (4 - 6 months neo-adjuvant, concurrent, 1.5 - 2 years' adjuvant) with intensity modulated radiation therapy to a dose of 76 - 78 Gy in conventional fractionation or equivalent doses in moderate hypofractionation (Eg: 68 Gy/ 25 fractions over 5 weeks). Pelvic nodal irradiation to an equivalent dose of 50 Gy should be considered (Level 2).

## Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Summary of evidence for non-surgical management in high risk prostate cancer

Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in Radiotherapy: A combined modality approach should be used consisting of external beam radiotherapy (preferably IMRT) plus long-term ADT (2-3 years) [126, 127]. A radiation dose of 76-78 Gy or equivalent doses Eg - 60Gy/ 20# in 4 weeks should be delivered [128, 129].

Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 sub areas (districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya. The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Nagaland, Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, males in Prophylactic lymph node irradiation should be considered in patients with expected lymph node involvement &gt; 20% calculated by Roach Formula because of benefits in terms of Biochemical failure free survival, disease free survival and distant metastasis free survival [130]. The dose of 68 Gy in 25 fractions in 5 weeks to prostate along with 50 Gy to pelvic nodes is preferred.

Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/100,000 for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus (in both males

## East had already reported high incidence rates of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract that would Role of brachytherapy boost in high risk prostate cancer:

include anatomical sites such as, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, oesophagus and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district) and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly oesophagus, hypopharynx and larynx. Brachytherapy boost after external beam radiation along with ADT has been shown to improve biochemical progression free survival without improvement in overall survival [131, 132]. The risks and benefits of brachytherapy boost have to be discussed with patients and may be considered in fit patients with minimal co-morbidities.

## Management of locally advanced prostate PCa:

Cancer Research in ICMR Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the There are no level 1 evidence comparing RP as part of a multi-modal treatment strategy vs. upfront EBRT with ADT. These patients with locally advanced disease can be offered an option of surgery as a part of multi-modal therapy (Adjuvant ADT+RT). An eLND should be done bilaterally as it might have survival benefit [134, 135].

states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya. Ideal: 2 - 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy (4 - 6 months neo-adjuvant, concurrent, 1.5 - 2 years adjuvant) with intensity modulated radiation therapy to a dose of 76 - 78 Gy in conventional fractionation or equivalent doses in moderate hypofractionation (Eg: 68 Gy/ 25 fractions over 5 weeks). Pelvic nodal boost should be considered.

Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills Essential: 2 - 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy or orchidectomy (after explaining side effects to patients) with radiation therapy up to a dose of 70 Gy. It is preferable to refer such patients to centres with advanced techniques of radiation therapy.

## district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females Radiotherapy for locally advanced PCa

respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.1% in Meghalaya to 4.4% in Delhi. Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 sub areas (districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya. A combined modality approach should be used consisting of external beam radiotherapy (preferably IMRT) plus long-term ADT (2-3 years). A radiation dose of 76-78 Gy or equivalent doses E.g - 60Gy/20# in 4 weeks should be delivered. A lymph node boost may be considered.

## The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Nagaland, Role of SABR in locally advanced prostate cancer:

Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, males in In the absence of level 1 evidence, SABR cannot be recommended.

## Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/100,000 for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus (in both males Role of brachytherapy boost in locally advanced prostate cancer:

and females) and cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx in males. Nonetheless, the states of the North In the absence of level 1 evidence, brachytherapy cannot be recommended

East had already reported high incidence rates of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract that would include anatomical sites such as, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, oesophagus and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district) Particle therapy: No level 1 evidence comparing external beam photon, brachytherapy and particle therapy is available to adopt proton therapy or carbon ion therapy in routine clinical practise. Available evidence show a slightly reduced gastro-intestinal and Genito-urinary toxicity [137, 138]

## and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly oesophagus, Criteria for failure/recurrence after radiotherapy

hypopharynx and larynx. The details of individual registry write-up including that of Patiala, Naharlagun and Pasighat PBCRs were Biochemical failure after external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy is defined as a PSA rise of 2 ng/ mL or more above nadir PSA after treatment (Phoenix criteria)

Quality of Data

The authenticity of the data depends on its quality and the completeness of coverage of cancer cases in the geographical area (quantity) and timeliness in data abstraction and is comprehensively covered in Chapter 9. This chapter along with Chapter 5 that addressed the most valid basis of diagnosis of cancer Salvage RP is a reasonable option for a selected group of patient with local recurrence after RT, though complication (erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, bladder neck contracture) rates are higher than when RP used as initial therapy [136]

## Recommendations:

Ideal: All patients of mCSPC should be prescribed ADT, either medical or surgical castration based on patient preference and available resources. In view of significant benefit of addition of therapy beyond ADT, it should be a routine practice to add Docetaxel/ Abiraterone/ Enzalutamide (Level 1). The therapy selection is guided by the comorbidities, and patient/physician preference. The patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials, if available.

Essential: All patients of mCSPC should receive ADT plus additional treatment (Docetaxel/ Abiraterone/ Enzalutamide), exception being patients with significant uncontrolled comorbidities.

## Summary of evidence for mCSPC

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): Lowering of serum testosterone levels to castrate levels ( &lt; 50 ng/ ml) is an integral component of the primary approach to the systemic treatment of mCSPC. All patients undergoing ADT therapy should be monitored for diabetes, hypertension, and lipid profile at regular intervals (3-6 monthly) besides evaluation of bone health. Patients on ADT should be given calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan can be considered in patients of age &gt; 65 years, or having history of use of steroids. Patients experiencing significant vasomotor symptoms like hot flushes can be offered venlafaxine 75mg/day, or medroxyprogesterone acetate 20 mg daily [139].

## ADT options:

ADT can be accomplished either by surgical orchiectomy (castration) or medical castration (using either a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist or a GnRH antagonist). Both medical castration and surgical orchiectomy are effective methods for lowering serum testosterone levels in males with advanced CSPC and confer similar survival benefit. The decision between medical and surgical treatment is based on a variety of factors, including patient preference, cost, and treatment availability.

The benefit of surgical castration being lower overall cost, avoidance of injections for continued medical castration, and potentially fewer hospital visits. The benefit of medical castration being absence of direct psychological impact of castration. Western literature suggests that only 5.4% patients undergo surgical castration, after explaining all the options [140].

However, the situation seems to be different in countries with limited resources, including India.

Cancer Research in ICMR Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth GnRH agonists - Synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs are commonly used in the real-world practice. Leuprolide, goserelin, and triptorelin are used. The depot preparations are usually administered by intramuscular route. However, there is now data that subcutaneous administration of some formulations such as Triptorelin pamoate is equivalent and more convenient [141].

cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer When agonists are started in patients with patients with significant disease burden, it is recommended to add Bicalutamide 50mg OD for two weeks to avoid the risk of tumor flare.

of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya. Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females GnRH antagonists - Antagonists like Degarelix are administered subcutaneously every month and have been reported to be equally efficacious as agonists, though they cause deeper suppression of testosterone. However, the advantage of antagonist being rapid suppression of testosterone levels, which is required in patients with impending spinal cord compression, or visceral crisis. Being an antagonist, degarelix does not cause flare reactions. Also, antagonists are reported have lower risk of cardiac events, thus, preferred in patients with cardiac comorbidities. However, recent data from PRONOUNCE study failed to find any difference between degarelix and leuprolide in terms of major cardiovascular event at one-year [142].

respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.1% in Meghalaya to 4.4% in Delhi. Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 sub areas (districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya. It should be noted that a new oral LHRH antagonist, Relugolix 120 mg OD is now approved for use based on phase III HERO study. However, it is not yet available in India and has not shown superiority over Leuprolide in terms of castrate resistance free survival. Also, compliance might be uncertain as it requires once daily administration [143].

The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Nagaland, Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, males in Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/100,000 for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus (in both males Combined Androgen Blockade (CAB): Combination of anti-androgen like Bicalutamide with surgical or medical castration is widely practised. However, no prospective randomized study has demonstrated the benefit of this approach over ADT alone. Also, CAB is expected to add to adverse effects of the ADT. Thus, CAB is not recommended in absence of data of superior efficacy over ADT alone.

and females) and cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx in males. Nonetheless, the states of the North East had already reported high incidence rates of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract that would include anatomical sites such as, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, oesophagus and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district) ADT plus Abiraterone: Abiraterone with prednisolone 5 mg once a day is approved in combination with ADT based on survival benefit in two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of abiraterone and low-dose prednisone plus ADT that were reported in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer or high-risk or node-positive disease [145, 146].

Use of Electronic Information Technology Abiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered following a low-fat breakfast, as an alternative to the dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast. Though the data for this dose is limited and derived from phase 2 studies in castrate resistant settings, the cost savings (one-fourth of full dose) may reduce financial toxicity and improve compliance, especially in resource constraint settings.

## ADT plus Enzalutamide:

ADT plus enzalutamide has improved survival in mCSPC and may be considered an option

## Summary of evidence for ADT plus Enzalutamide

The open-label randomized phase 3 ENZAMET clinical trial compared enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT with a first-generation anti-androgen (Bicalutamide, nilutamide, or flutamide) plus ADT in 1125 patients with mCSPC. The primary endpoint of OS was met at the first interim analysis with median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.86; P = .002). Enzalutamide also improved secondary endpoints, such as PFS using PSA levels and clinical PFS [148, 149]. Enzalutamide does not require concurrent prednisolone administration and thus, is preferred in patients where steroids need to be avoided.

## ADT plus Apalutamide:

ADT plus Apalutamide has improved survival in mCSPC and may be considered an option. The drug is presently not available in India.

## Summary of evidence for ADT plus Apalutamide

TITAN study found that median OS was improved with apalutamide plus ADT compared with ADT alone after a median follow-up of 44 months (NR vs. 52.2 months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.79; P &lt; .001). Based on this data, Apalutamide is an approved option in combination with ADT in mCSPC, however it is not yet available in India [150].

## ADT plus Docetaxel:

Docetaxel is also included as an upfront option for patients with mCSPC and distant metastases based on results from two phase 3 trials [151, 152].

## Summary of evidence for ADT plus Docetaxel

CHAARTED randomized 790 patients with metastatic, castration-naïve prostate cancer to docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x 6 doses) plus ADT or ADT alone. After a median follow-up of 53.7 months, the patients in the combination arm experienced a longer OS than those in the ADT arm (57.6 months vs. 47.2 months; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89; P = .002).755

Subgroup analysis showed that the survival benefit was more pronounced in the 65% of participants with high-volume disease (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; P &lt; .001). Patients with low-volume disease in CHAARTED did not derive a survival benefit from the inclusion of docetaxel (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.70-1.55; P = .86).

The results of STAMPEDE trial in the M1 population essentially confirmed the survival advantage of adding docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x 6 doses) to ADT seen in the CHAARTED trial. In STAMPEDE, extent of disease was not evaluated in the 1087 patients with metastatic disease, but the median OS for all patients with M1 disease was 5.4 years in the ADT-plus-docetaxel arm versus 3.6 years in the ADTonly arm (a difference of 1.8 years between groups compared with a 1.1-year difference in CHAARTED). The results of the STAMPEDE trial seem to confirm the results of the CHAARTED trial.

The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district) and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly oesophagus, hypopharynx and larynx.

Quality of Data The authenticity of the data depends on its quality and the completeness of coverage of cancer cases Ideal: The patients diagnosed with mCRPC should be offered testing for HRR and MSI testing, if available and feasible. If patient was on medical castration, it should be continued to maintain castrate levels of testosterone. If patient has not received anything other than ADT previously, the patients can be offered Docetaxel/ Abiraterone, or Enzalutamide based on patient / physician preference, and the comorbidities (Level 1). Since there is clear data that Abiraterone does not have activity in patients treated previously with Enzalutamide but Enzalutamide retains some of the activity post use of Abiraterone, it is usually recommended to use Abiraterone first, however, this is subject to physician preference and the comorbidities of the patient. If patient has received Abiraterone/ Enzalutamide previously, docetaxel should be offered, if patient is fit enough to receive the same. Sequential use of Abiraterone and Enzalutamide should be avoided in view of significant cross-resistance.

## Summary of evidence for enzalutamide in CRPC

A randomized phase III trial (PREVAIL) included a similar patient population to COU-AAA-302 trial and compared enzalutamide and placebo. The trial also included patients with visceral metastases, though their numbers were small. PREVAIL showed a significant improvement in both rPFS and OS The median OS improved by approximately 2 months (32.4 vs 30.2 months). Fatigue and hypertension were the most common clinically relevant adverse events. Enzalutamide was equally effective and well tolerated in men &gt; 75 years as well as in those with or without visceral metastases [156 - 161].

## Docetaxel

## Summary of evidence for docetaxel in CRPC

A statistically significant improvement in median survival of 2.0-2.9 months has been shown with docetaxel based chemotherapy compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in trials. The standard firstline chemotherapy presently should be docetaxel 75 mg/m2, 3-weekly doses combined with prednisone 5 mg twice a day (BID), up to 10 cycles. Prednisone can be omitted in absence of major symptoms or if contraindicated. Only consideration by age should not be a contraindication to docetaxel. In men with mCRPC who are unable to tolerate the standard dose and schedule, docetaxel 50 mg/m2 every two weeks appears well tolerated with less grade 3-4 adverse events [162 - 165].

Side effects of the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib include rash and diarrhea. This combination is still investigational [167].

## Cabazitaxel

Cabazitaxel is a newer taxane with activity in docetaxel-resistant cancers. It was studied in a large prospective, randomized, phase III trial (TROPIC) comparing cabazitaxel plus prednisone vs. mitoxantrone plus prednisone in 755 patients with mCRPC, who had progressed after or during docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

Cancer Research in ICMR Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya. Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills Patients received a maximum of ten cycles of cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2) or mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2) plus prednisone (10 mg/day). Overall survival improved by 3.4 months (median: 15.1 vs. 12.7 months, p &lt; 0.0001). There was also an improvement in PFS by 1.4 months (median: 2.8 vs. 1.4 months, p &lt; 0.0001). Treatment-associated WHO grade 3-4 adverse events developed significantly more often in the cabazitaxel arm, particularly hematological (68.2% vs. 47.3%, p &lt; 0.0002) but also non-hematological (57.4 vs. 39.8%, p &lt; 0.0002) toxicity. In two post-marketing randomized phase III trials, cabazitaxel was shown not to be superior to docetaxel in the first-line setting; In the second-line setting in terms of OS, 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel was not inferior to 25 mg/m2, but less toxic. Therefore, the lower dose should be preferred. Cabazitaxel should preferably be given with prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and should preferably be administered in settings with expertise in handling neutropenia and sepsis [168 - 172]. In selected patients who do not seem to be fit to receive docetaxel in mCRPC setting, can be considered for Cabazitaxel upfront. This recommendation is based on a randomized trial showing less fatigue and better quality of life in patients receiving Cabazitaxel before Docetaxel.

All patients who progressed (as per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria) after docetaxel therapy (with a maximum of two previous chemotherapeutic regimens) were included. After a median follow-up of 20.2 months, the median survival in the abiraterone group improved by 4.6 months (15.8 vs 11.2 months; HR: 0.74, p &lt; 0.0001). The benefit was observed in all subgroups. The incidence of the most common grade 3-4 adverse events did not differ significantly between arms, but mineralocorticoid-related side effects were more frequent in the abiraterone group, mainly grade 1-2 (fluid retention, edema and hypokalemia) [173, 174].

Use of Electronic Information Technology The only bone-specific drug that is associated with a survival benefit is the alpha emitter radium-223. In a large phase III trial (ALSYMPCA) 921 patients with symptomatic mCRPC, who failed or were unfit for docetaxel, were randomized to six injections of 50 kBq/kg radium-223 or placebo, plus standard of care.

The associated toxicity was mild and, apart from slightly more hematologic toxicity and diarrhea with radium-223, it did not differ significantly from that in the placebo arm. Radium-223 was effective and safe whether or not patients were docetaxel pre-treated. Due to safety concerns, use of radium-223 was recently restricted to after docetaxel and at least one AR targeted agent. However, it is seldom used in real clinical practice as it works only in patients with skeletal only metastasis [176 - 179].

## Treatment after docetaxel and one line of hormonal treatment for mCRPC

## Summary of evidence for second line treatment for mCRPC

For men progressing quickly on AR targeted therapy ( &lt; 12 months), cabazitaxel is the treatment supported by the best data. The CARD trial, an open label randomized phase III trial, evaluated cabazitaxel after docetaxel and one line of androgen receptor targeting agent (ARTA) (either abiraterone plus prednisolone or enzalutamide). It included patients progressing in less than 12 months on previous abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC. The median overall survival improved by 2.6 months (13.6 vs 11.0 months; HR: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; P=0.008). The median progression-free survival increased by almost 2 months (4.4 vs 2.7 months; p &lt; 0.001). The rPFS with cabazitaxel remained superior regardless of the ARTA sequence and if docetaxel was given before, or after, the first ARTA [180].

The choice of further treatment after docetaxel and one line of hormonal treatment for mCRPC is open for patients who have a &gt; 12 months' response to first-line abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC. Either radium-223 or second-line chemotherapy (cabazitaxel) are reasonable options [181 - 185]. In general, subsequent treatments in unselected patients are expected to have less benefit than with earlier use and there is evidence of cross-resistance between enzalutamide and abiraterone. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors have shown high rates of response in men with somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency in initial studies. Men previously treated with both docetaxel and at least one ARTA and whose tumours demonstrated homozygous deletions or deleterious mutations in DNA repair genes showed an 88% response rate to olaparib and in another confirmatory trial a confirmed composite response of 54.3% (95% CI: 39.0-69.1) in the 400 mg cohort and in 18 of 46 (39.1%; 25.1-54.6) evaluable patients in the 300 mg cohort [186 - 190].

So far, two PARP inhibitors, olaparib and rucaparib, are licensed by the FDA (EMA only approved olaparib) and several other PARP inhibitors are under investigation (e.g., talazoparib, niraparib). A randomized phase III trial (PROfound) compared the PARP inhibitor olaparib to an alternative ARTA in mCRPC with alterations in &gt; 1 of any qualifying gene with a role in HRR and progression on an ARTA. Most patients were heavily pre-treated with 1-2 chemotherapies and up to 2 ARTAs. In patients with BRCA 1 / 2 or ATM mutation, median rPFS improved by almost 4 months (7.4 vs. 3.6 months; HR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.25 to 0.47; P &lt; 0.001) [191]. Of note, patients in the physician's choice of enzalutamide/abiraterone-arm who progressed, 66% (n = 86/131) crossed over to olaparib. In patients harboring other mutations, there was no improvement in rPFS or OS. The most common adverse events were anaemia (46.1% vs. 15.4%), nausea (41.4% vs. 19.2%), decreased appetite (30.1% vs. 17.7%) and fatigue (26.2% vs. 20.8%) for olaparib vs. enzalutamide/abiraterone. Among patients receiving olaparib 16.4% discontinued treatment secondary
