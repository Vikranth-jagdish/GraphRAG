## Levels of Evidence

Level 1: High quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing (a) a statistically significant difference or (b) no statistically significant difference with narrow confidence intervals; systematic reviews of Level I RCTs

Level 2: Lesser quality RCTs (e.g. &lt; 80% follow-up, no blinding, or improper randomization); prospective comparative studies; systematic reviews of Level II studies or of Level I studies with inconsistent results

Level 3: Case control studies; retrospective comparative studies; systematic reviews of Level III studies; retrospective studies

- Level 4: Case series
- Level 5: Expert opinions

The set of recommendations can be divided into 2 categories:

Desirable/Ideal: Tests and treatments that may not be available at all centres but the centres should aspire to have them in the near future.

Essential: Bare minimum that should be offered to all patients by all centres treating patients with cancer.

## Categories of Evidence

Tobacco: A Public Health Problem

Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the

states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizor of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and

the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesop followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lun

leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers

Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvanant in Kerala state. Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. Eas district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and fem respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.% in Meghalaya to 4.% in De Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 s (districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghal The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, m Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/0, for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus and females) and cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx in males. Nonetheless, the states Prostate cancer appears to be a growing problem in males in India. The incidence of prostate cancer has been steadily increasing in recent years [1]. As per the NCDIR database, prostate cancer features amongst the top 10 cancers in urban cancer registries of Bangalore, Delhi, Bhopal and Mumbai [1]. Prostate cancer seems to be less of a menace in rural areas. It does not feature in the top 10 cancer in the rural Barshi registry. Prostate cancer has moved from being the eighth most common cancer in males in 1990s to being the third most common cancer in Delhi and Mumbai by 2014. Similarly, in Bangalore, it has become the third most common cancer from being seventh in 1990s. There were 37416 reported prostate cancer cases in 2016 in India which has increased to 41532 in 2020.Prostate cancer incidence is expected to increase to over 47000 cases by 2025 [1]. This figure constitutes about 3% of total cancer cases in the country. Mean age of incidence of prostate cancer in India is 69.7 years [2]. Metabolic syndrome has been linked to prostate cancer but the evidence is weak [3]. Testosterone supplements do not increase the risk of prostate cancer in hypo gonadal male [4]. No specific life style and dietary modifications are recommended for prostate cancer [5].

and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of c 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (A and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly hypopharynx and larynx. The details of individual registry write-up including that of Patiala, Naharlagun and Pasigh provided at the end of the report. As per the available evidence population based screening cannot be recommended in Indian population in any age group (Level 1) [5]. There has been no improvement in prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival by routine population based screening [6].A person with known BRCA 2 mutation needs to be explained about increased risk of developing clinically significant prostate cancer. However, in view of limited evidence (Level 3) [7] routine screening with serum PSA cannot be recommended even for persons carrying BRCA2 mutation.

## Diagnosis

Patients presenting with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer are recommended to undergo a total serum PSA estimation.

If serum PSA &lt; 4 ng/ ml and digital rectal examination (DRE) is not suspicious: Evaluate for other causes like benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis etc.

If serum PSA is 4-10 ng/mL and DRE is not suspicious: Antibiotic for 1 week with fluoroquinolones followed by repeat PSA may be considered though advantage of this practice is doubtful [8].

## If serum PSA &gt; 10 or DRE is suspicious: Proceed for evaluation of prostate cancer diagnosis .

Role of mpMRI- Ideally a multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) of prostate is to be done prior to a systematic biopsy. If PIRADS ≥ 3 targeted biopsies along with systematic biopsy is to be done. If mp-MRI not available or PIRADS ≤ 2 only systematic biopsies is recommended [9, 10].

## Biopsy

1 st choice - Systematic 12 core biopsy by Trans-perineal route (low infection rates) [11]

2 nd choice - Systematic 12 core biopsy by Trans-rectal route

## In patients with strong clinical suspicion but negative biopsy -

To be kept on close follow up. Biopsy is to be repeated on rising PSA or persistently elevated PSA, only intra-ductal carcinoma in previous biopsy and positive mp-MRI findings.

## Summary of evidence for staging in prostate cancer

## Initial Staging:

Choice of staging options depends on the availability of different diagnostic modalities and the course of treatment planned. With multiple novel and well established diagnostic options available it is imperative to understand pros and cons of each so that a well informed decision can be made for the right diagnostic test.

## T-staging:

## Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS):

Even though some single-centre studies reported good results using 3D TRUS or colour Doppler for local staging, these have not been confirmed by large scale studies [12, 13]. Thus, TRUS is no more accurate at predicting organ-confined disease than DRE [14] and NOT recommended for initial T staging.

## MRI:

MRI has proven to be the most useful for local staging of prostate cancer, with T2-weighted imaging being the most reliable. For T3 stage prostate cancers, MRI has good specificity but low sensitivity for assessment of extra prostatic extension and seminal vesicle involvement as shown in a pooled data from a meta-analysis with overall sensitivity and specificity of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.54-0.67) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.91) respectively [15] [Level 2 evidence]. In low-risk patients MRI is not recommended because of its low sensitivity in detection of focal (microscopic) extra prostatic extension. Addition of a 3T MRI or functional imaging along with T2-weighted imaging improves sensitivity for detection of extra prostatic extension and seminal vesicle involvement, but there is potentially large inter-reader variability [16]. MRI even though cannot be recommended for local staging in low-risk patients, still has a useful role in treatment planning [17-19].

## N category:

## CT and MRI:

Anatomical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI assess nodes based on their size and morphology. Nodes with short axis diameter &gt; 8mm in pelvis and &gt; 10mm outside pelvis are considered to be involved

Cancer Research in ICMR with a sensitivity of less than 40 [20, 21]. Diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) may detect metastases in normal sized nodes, but a negative DW-MRI cannot rule out nodal metastases [22, 23].

## Choline PET/CT:

Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya. Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram For identification of pelvic nodal metastases with choline PET/CT a meta-analysis of 609 patients revealed pooled sensitivity and specificity to be 62% (95% CI: 51-66%) and 92% (95% CI: 89-94%) respectively. The sensitivity of choline PET/CT increases to 50% in patients at high risk and to 71% in patients at very high risk, in both cases performing better than CECT [24] [Level 2 evidence]. When comparing choline PET/CT with DW-MRI, studies yielded contradictory results with sensitivity of PET/CT reported to be inferior [24], superior [25] and similar [26, 27] than that of DW-MRI. Due to its low sensitivity and poor widespread availability choline PET/CT role in regular patient workup need to be evaluated further.

Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.1% in Meghalaya to 4.4% in Delhi. Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 sub areas (districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya. The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Nagaland, Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, males in Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/100,000 for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus (in both males and females) and cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx in males. Nonetheless, the states of the North East had already reported high incidence rates of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract that would include anatomical sites such as, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, oesophagus and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT uses different radio-isotopes such as 68 Ga, 18 F and 64 Cu (including Tc99m PSMA SPECT/CT) most common being 68 Ga and 18 F. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis no significant difference in terms of detection rate was noted among the most commonly used PSMA-radiotracers ( 68 Ga PSMA-11, 18 F-PSMA-1007, 18 F-DCFPyL), but a clear superiority to choline and fluciclovine was demonstrated [28]. In a meta-analysis comprising of 10 studies overall sensitivity and specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.55-0.95), specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.87-0.98) [29]. In a meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of PSMA PET/CT for nodal staging in a per node analysis was 75% and 99% respectively [30] [Level 2 evidence]. In a prospective multi-centric validation study in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer with a negative bone scan per patient-based sensitivity and specificity was 41.5% (95% CI: 26.7-57.8) and 91% (95% CI: 79.3-96.6) respectively, with treatment change occurring in 12.6% patients [31][Level 2 evidence]. According to a systematic review, with compared to mpMRI, 68 Ga PSMA PET/CT was found to have higher sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI: 0.490.79) compared to mpMRI sensitivity of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26-0.57) with a comparable specificity 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88-0.97) of 68 Ga PSMA and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95) [Level 2 evidence].

The details of individual registry write-up including that of Patiala, Naharlagun and Pasighat PBCRs were provided at the end of the report. Quality of Data PSMA PET/MRI has a new evolving role in work up and follow up of prostate cancer. A recent metaanalysis evaluating the role of PET/MRI for evaluation of prostate cancer revealed pooled sensitivity and specificity for primary tumour (per lesion) as 61.5% and 90.9% respectively and for lymph node metastatic (per lesion) as 64.3% and 97.4% sensitivity and specificity respectively [32] [Level 2 evidence]. Impact of better diagnosis using PET MRI on treatment and survival needs to evaluated further.

In more recent years the PBCR software applications programme has greatly helped in enhancing the speed of data submission and its quality. Use of Electronic Information Technology Bone scan has been the most widely used method of evaluation of bone metastases of Prostate cancer. A meta-analysis shows combined sensitivity and specificity of 79% (95% CI: 73-83%) and 82% (95% CI: 7885%) respectively [Level 2 evidence]. 18 F-NaF PET/CT has superior sensitivity with a similar specificity for detecting skeletal metastases in newly diagnosed high risk prostate cancer [33, 34]. But in a prospective study, 18 F -NaF showed no added value over bone scintigraphy in newly diagnosed intermediate/high risk prostate cancer patients with negative bone scintigraphy [35].

## Whole Body-MRI (WB MRI):

In a prospective study with 100 patients comparing diffusion weighted WB-MRI (DW-WB MRI) with conventional imaging including bone scan revealed that DW-WB MRI is more sensitive than bone scan in detecting bone metastases in high risk patients [36] [Level 2 evidence]. WB MRI is also more sensitive and specific than combined bone scan, targeted radiography and abdominopelvic CT [37]. Compared to choline PET/CT WB-MRI is more sensitive while choline PET/CT shows higher specificity [38]

## PSMA PET/CT:

A recent systematic review consisting of 12 studies with a total of 332 patients evaluating the role of 68 Ga PSMA PET in primary staging of prostate cancer revealed high variation in sensitivity (median sensitivity on per lesion analysis of 33-92% and on per-patient analysis of 66- 91%) with good specificity (per lesion 82-100% and per patient 67-99%), with most studies demonstrating increased detection rates with respect to conventional imaging modalities (bone scan and CT) [Level 2 evidence]. A prospective multi-centric randomized study comparing Ga 68 PSMA PET/CT to conventional imaging in 302 high risk prostate cancer patients, PSMA had higher accuracy (92% of PSMA v/s 65% of conventional imaging) and led to change in management in higher number of patients (27% with PSMA v/s 5% with conventional imaging) [39] [Level 1 evidence]. However, it is unclear if the stage shifts with more sensitive modalities (e.g. PSMA) adds to any clinical benefit and whether patients with metastases detectable only with MRI or PET/CT should be managed with systemic therapies or they should be subjected to aggressive local treatment with metastases directed therapies.

## Role of imaging in relapsing and metastatic prostate cancer:

Biochemical relapse (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy (RT) precedes clinical metastases by 7-8 yrs. Therefore, accuracy of conventional imaging techniques (bone scans, CT and MRI) is poor in asymptomatic patients especially with low PSA. Usually in men with PSA only relapse after RP, salvage radiotherapy is offered to the patient on the basis of biochemical relapse without confirming with imaging.

A meta-analysis revealed that choline PET/CT is strongly influenced by PSA level and kinetics [40] Sensitivity is only 5-24% when the PSA level is &lt; 1ng/mL [41]. PSMA PET/CT is more sensitive than other imaging modalities especially for PSA level &lt; 1ng/mL [40, 42]. Scan positivity rate of Ga 68 PSMA PET/CT for PSA level &lt; 1ng/mL are 33% (95%CI: 16-51), for 0.0 to 0.19ng/mL PSA, 45% (95%CI: 3952) for 0.2-0.49ng/mL PSA, and 59% (95%CI: 50-68) for 0.5-0.99ng/mL PSA respectively.

In patients with BCR after RT, there is high morbidity of local salvage options hence its necessary to obtain a histological proof for local recurrence before offering treatment [43]. MpMRI has shown excellent results in detecting local recurrences [43]. PET has poor spatial resolution compared to MRI, a study for evaluation of a combination of PET/MR in setting of biochemical relapse could be worthwhile.

## Recommendations for active surveillance

## Inclusion criteria

1. For inclusion, patients must have a life expectancy of 10 years, but there is no lower or upper age limit for inclusion.
2. Evaluate life expectancy using a combination of performance status, co morbidity index, and health status screening.
3. Patients of low risk prostate cancer (NCCN criteria) to be considered. Patients with low-risk localized disease should be excluded if the extent and/or stage of disease is high based on mpMRI.
4. Patients with Gleason 3+4=7(ISUPgrade2) may be considered, if favorable characteristics are present, including PSA ( &lt; 10), clinical stage (cT2a), and biopsy characteristics (low core positivity).
5. Patients with intra-ductal and cribriform histology on biopsy should be excluded automatically.

## Monitoring and follow-up criteria

1. During active surveillance, men should have their PSA checked every 6 months.
2. During active surveillance, men should have a DRE every 12 months.
3. During active surveillance, repeat biopsy should be performed if there is a change in mpMRI (ie, increase in PI-RADS score, lesion volume, or radiological T stage), or by DRE progression or PSA progression.
4. If repeat biopsies are needed, they should be performed by mpMRI guided targeted biopsies (including in-bore, cognitive guidance, or mpMRI fusion) with systematic biopsies. However, it remains unclear when mpMRI should be performed during monitoring, and whether it should be performed routinely or triggered (Eg: by PSA or DRE changes)
5. Active surveillance should only be continued in patients if their life expectancy continues to be 10 years.

## Reclassification criteria (i.e., leaving active surveillance for an active treatment)

1. Re-classification should apply only to patients with life expectancy of 10 years at the time of assessment.
2. Consider reclassifying patients if they develop anxiety or depression due to prostate cancer.
3. Consider reclassifying patients if they are reluctant to undergo repeat biopsies or repeat imaging.

4. Patients should not be reclassified automatically based on any one criteria of

and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district) and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly oesophagus, hypopharynx and larynx. The details of individual registry write-up including that of Patiala, Naharlagun and Pasighat PBCRs were provided at the end of the report. Quality of Data The goal of radical prostatectomy (RP) is cancer control with preservation of organ function [46]. The procedure involves removal of the entire prostate with its capsule and seminal vesicles (SVs), followed by vesico-urethral anastomosis. The nerve sparing technique of RP is preferred in low risk disease [47]. Temporary urinary incontinence is common early after surgery. Pre-operative pelvic floor exercises (PFE) with, or without biofeedback may reduce the incidence of urinary incontinence. Prophylactic antibiotics should be used; however, no high-level evidence is available to recommend specific prophylactic antibiotics prior to RP.

This chapter along with Chapter 5 that addressed the most valid basis of diagnosis of cancer and Chapter 6 dealing with mortality data show the challenges and limitations of cancer registration in the Indian context vis-à-vis International comparisons. Every effort was made by both the individual PBCRs and the coordinators at NCDIR to ensure that the data reported was as correct and as complete as possible. In more recent years the PBCR software applications programme has greatly helped in enhancing the speed of data submission and its quality. Neoadjuvant ADT is associated with a decreased rate of pT3 (i.e. down staging possible), decreased positive margins, and a lower incidence of positive lymph nodes. But neoadjuvant ADT is not associated with improvement in survival. So, it should not be considered as standard clinical practice. A small recent RCT comparing ADT vs ADT plus Abiraterone in the neo-adjuvant setting found significant reduction in tumour volume and lower biochemical relapse at &gt; 4 years (p = 0.0014) [48]. Till level 1 evidences come, do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before surgery.

## Surgical techniques

Prostatectomy can be performed by open-, laparoscopic- or robot-assisted (RARP) approaches. The initial open technique of RP described by Young in 1904 was via the perineum [49]. The open retropubic approach was popularised by Walshin. It permitted a bilateral nerve-sparing procedure [50]. The first laparoscopic RP was reported in 1997 performed by trans-perineal route [51]. Most recently, robot assisted prostatectomy (RARP) was introduced using the da Vinci Surgical SystemR by Binder in 2002 [52].

In a randomised phase III trial, RARP was shown to reduce blood loss during surgery and duration of hospital stay, without improvement in early (12 weeks) or late functional or oncological outcomes compared to open RP [53, 54]. A recent Cochrane review comparing either RARP or LRP vs. open RP found no significant differences for oncological, urinary and sexual function outcomes, although RARP and LRP both resulted in statistically significant decrease in blood loss and duration of hospital stay [55]. Inform patients that no surgical approach (open-, laparoscopic- or robotic radical prostatectomy) has clearly shown superiority in terms of functional or oncological results.

A recent systematic review found with moderate certainty that retzius sparing (RS) RARP as compared to standard RARP improved continence at 1 month, 3 months as well as 12 months [56]. A single-surgeon propensity score matched analysis of 1,863 patients reached the same conclusion as the systematic review [57].

## Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND)

PLND during RP has so far failed to improve oncological outcomes, including survival [58]. It can be performed via extended (eLND) or limited approach however a RCT failed to show oncological benefit of an extended approach [59]. However, eLND provides important information for staging and prognosis [60, 61]. So, when a lymph node dissection (LND) is deemed necessary, perform an extended LND template for optimal staging. The patients with low risk disease usually do not require LND.

The individual risk of patients harbouring positive LNs can be estimated based on validated nomograms. The Briganti nomogram [62, 63], the Roach formula [64] or the Partin and MSKCC nomograms [65] have shown similar diagnostic accuracy in predicting LN invasion. These nomograms have all been developed in the pre-MRI setting based on systematic random biopsy. A risk of nodal metastases over 5% can be used to identify candidates for nodal sampling by eLND during RP [66, 67].

An updated nomogram has been externally validated in men diagnosed based on mpMRI followed by MRI targeted biopsy [68]. Based on this nomogram, patients can be spared an eLND if their risk of nodal involvement is less than 7%; which would result in missing only 1.5% of patients with nodal invasion [68].

## Surgical techniques dilemmas

1. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) - There is insufficient high-quality evidence supporting oncological effectiveness of SNB [69, 70].
2. Prostatic anterior fat pad (PAFP) excision - The PAFP is always removed at RP for exposure of the endo-pelvic fascia and should be sent for histologic analysis as it contains metastatic PCa in up to 1.3% of intermediate- and high-risk patients [71, 72].

- Cancer Research in ICMR 3. Management of the dorsal venous complex - Given the relatively small differences in outcomes, the surgeon's choice to ligate prior to transection or not, or whether to use sutures or a stapler, will depend on their familiarity with the technique and the equipment available [73, 74].
- Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the 4. Nerve-sparing surgery - During prostatectomy, preservation of the neurovascular bundles with parasympathetic nerve branches of the pelvic plexus may spare erectile function [75, 76]. Extra-, inter-, and intra-fascial dissection planes can be planned, with those closer to the prostate and performed bilaterally associated with superior (early) functional outcomes [77 - 80]. Do not perform nerve-sparing surgery when there is a risk of ipsilateral extracapsular extension (based on cT stage, ISUP grade, nomogram, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging) [81, 82].

leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya.

- Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Chapter 3 of report gives the proportion of cancers associated with the use of tobacco. East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya had the highest relative proportion with 69.3% and 43.0% for males and females respectively. Chapter 4 deals with different types of cancers in childhood. The proportion of cancers in 5. Role of frozen section of lymph nodes during radical prostatectomy - Although no RCTs are available, data from prospective cohort studies comparing survival of pN+ patients (as defined following pathological examination after RP) support that RP may have a survival benefit over abandonment of RP in node-positive cases [83]. As a consequence, there is no role for performing frozen section of suspicious LNs.
- childhood relative to cancers of all ages in both sexes varied from 1.1% in Meghalaya to 4.4% in Delhi. Chapter 7 provides a comparison of cancer incidence and patterns in 25 PBCRs along with 5 sub areas (districts or combination of districts) within the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya. The data of the newer PBCRs that were being reported for the first time in this report are Nagaland, 6. Removal of seminal vesicles - The more aggressive forms of PCa may spread directly into the seminal vesicles (SVs). For oncological clearance, the SVs have traditionally been removed intact with the prostate specimen. Whilst complete SV removal should be the default, preservation of the SV tips may be considered in cases of low risk of involvement [84, 85].
- Meghalaya including Khasi Hills district, Tripura and Wardha. Among these new PBCRs, males in Nagaland showed the highest AAR of 21/100,000 for nasopharyngeal cancer. East Khasi Hills district and Meghalaya state as a whole showed the highest AAR in cancers of the oesophagus (in both males 7. Techniques of vesico-urethral anastomosis Several methods have been described. However, no clear recommendations are possible due to the lack of high-certainty evidence. In practice, the chosen method should be based on surgeon familiarity and preference [86, 87].
- and females) and cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx in males. Nonetheless, the states of the North East had already reported high incidence rates of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract that would include anatomical sites such as, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, oesophagus and even stomach. The international comparisons of the incidence rates of these sites of cancer (Chapter 8) reveal that the PBCRs at Meghalaya (especially East Khasi Hills district) and Mizoram (Aizawl district) and Kamrup in Assam reported the highest AARs of cancers of these sites, particularly oesophagus, hypopharynx and larynx. The details of individual registry write-up including that of Patiala, Naharlagun and Pasighat PBCRs were provided at the end of the report. 8. Bladder neck management - Some surgeons perform mucosal eversion of the bladder neck as its own step in open RP with the aim of securing a mucosa-to-mucosa vesico-urethral anastomosis and avoiding anastomotic stricture. A non-randomised study of 211 patients with and without bladder neck mucosal eversion showed no significant difference in anastomotic stricture rate [88]. Bladder neck preservation should be performed routinely when the cancer is distant from the base as it has shown to improve urinary continence post-operatively [89]. However, bladder neck preservation cannot be performed in the presence of a large median lobe or a previous TURP as it carries risk of margin positivity.
- Quality of Data The authenticity of the data depends on its quality and the completeness of coverage of cancer cases in the geographical area (quantity) and timeliness in data abstraction and is comprehensively covered in Chapter 9. This chapter along with Chapter 5 that addressed the most valid basis of diagnosis of cancer 9. Urethral length preservation - The length of preserved membranous urethra is chiefly responsible for urinary continence. A systematic review and meta-analysis has found that every extra millimetre of membranous urethral length seen on MRI pre-operatively improves early return to continence post-RP [90].
- and Chapter 6 dealing with mortality data show the challenges and limitations of cancer registration in the Indian context vis-à-vis International comparisons. Every effort was made by both the individual PBCRs and the coordinators at NCDIR to ensure that the data reported was as correct and as complete as possible. In more recent years the PBCR software applications programme has greatly helped in enhancing the speed of data submission and its quality. 10. Cystography prior to catheter removal - Cystogram to assess anastomotic leakage is not indicated as standard of care before catheter removal 8 to 10 days after surgery [91]. If a cystogram is used, men with LUTS, large prostate, previous TURP or bladder neck reconstruction, may benefit as these factors have been associated with leakage [92, 93]. Contrast-enhanced transrectal US is an alternative to assess leakage [94].

Use of Electronic Information Technology

Software programmes developed in-house have to a great extent contributed to improving the quality and coverage. Data that is keyed is checked as per international norms. In terms of completeness of coverage

a new feature in the software monitors the data received from different sources of a particular registry and

11. Urinary catheter - A urinary catheter is routinely placed during RP to enable bladder rest and drainage of urine while the vesico-urethral anastomosis heals. Compared to a traditional catheter duration of around 1 week, some centres remove the transurethral catheter early (post-operative day 2-3) [95, 96].
12. Use of a pelvic drain - A pelvic drain has traditionally been used in RP for potential drainage of urine leaking from the vesico-urethral anastomosis, blood, or lymphatic fluid when a PLND has been performed. Two RCTs in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic setting have been performed [97, 98]. Patients with urine leak at intra-operative anastomosis watertight testing were excluded. Both trials showed non-inferiority in complication rates when no drain was used. When the anastomosis is found to be watertight intra-operatively, it is reasonable to avoid inserting a pelvic drain. There is no evidence to guide usage of a pelvic drain in PLND.

## Acute and chronic complications of surgery

Post-operative incontinence and erectile dysfunction are common problems following surgery for prostate cancer. At 1 year after surgery, approx. 20% patients have incontinence. Erectile dysfunction was observed in 70.4% after RALP and 74.7% after RRP. [99]. A RCT comparing RALP and RRP reported outcomes at 12 weeks in 326 patients and functional outcomes at 2 years [100]. Urinary function scores did not differ significantly between RRP vs. RALP at 6 and 12 weeks' post-surgery (p = 0.18). Overall complication rates of 19.8% vs. 8.2% were noted for eLND vs. limited LND, respectively, with lymphoceles (10.3% vs. 4.6%) being the most common adverse event [100]. Similar rates of lymphoceles have been observed in RALP series; however, in one subgroup analysis lymphoceles were more common with the extraperitoneal approach (19%) vs. the transperitoneal approach (0%) [101, 102].

RALP = robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy; RP = radical prostatectomy; RRP = radical retro-pubic prostatectomy.

## Non-surgical management of low risk prostate cancer:

Cancer Research in ICMR Thiruvananthapuram. All the PBCRs in Gujarat and Maharashtra states and Bhopal PBCR have mouth cancer as the leading site of cancer. Cancer of the oesophagus was the leading site in the registries in the External beam radiotherapy: Moderate hypofractionation has been shown to provide similar disease control in well conducted randomized controlled trials [103] in low risk prostate cancer. Dose fractionation of 70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks may be preferred (Level 1). No role of androgen deprivation therapy.

states of Assam and Meghalaya. Stomach cancer was the leading site in Sikkim and Mizoram while cancer of the nasopharynx is the leading site in Nagaland. Among females, cancer of the breast and cervix were the leading sites of cancer in 18 of 25 PBCRs. Cancer of the gallbladder and cancer of the oesophagus followed by cancer of breast as the leading site in Dibrugrah and Kamrup respectively. Lung was the leading site in Manipur and Mizoram. Cancer of the oesophagus led the list of cancers in Meghalaya. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR): SABR has been shown to provide similar biochemical control rates with very low gastro-intestinal and genito-urinary toxicity rates in low risk prostate cancer [104]. SABR to a dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions over 1.5 weeks may be considered where in advanced radiation techniques are available (Level 2)

Cancer of the thyroid followed by cancer of breast in the two PBCRs at Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state. Role of brachytherapy: Brachytherapy may be performed with low dose rate (LDR) (Level 1) or high dose rate (HDR). The indications and proposed doses are indicated below

The authenticity of the data depends on its quality and the completeness of coverage of cancer cases in the geographical area (quantity) and timeliness in data abstraction and is comprehensively covered in

Chapter 9. This chapter along with Chapter 5 that addressed the most valid basis of diagnosis of cancer and Chapter 6 dealing with mortality data show the challenges and limitations of cancer registration

in the Indian context vis-à-vis International comparisons. Every effort was made by both the individual

PBCRs and the coordinators at NCDIR to ensure that the data reported was as correct and as complete as possible. In more recent years the PBCR software applications programme has greatly helped in

enhancing the speed of data submission and its quality.

Use of Electronic Information Technology

Software programmes developed in-house have to a great extent contributed to improving the quality and coverage. Data that is keyed is checked as per international norms. In terms of completeness of coverage

a new feature in the software monitors the data received from different sources of a particular registry and
