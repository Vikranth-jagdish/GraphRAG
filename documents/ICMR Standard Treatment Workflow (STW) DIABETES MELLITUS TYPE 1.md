## Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)

## SYMPTOMS

## DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 1 ICD-10-E10

## Polydipsia

## Polyuria / Nocturia

Polyphagia

## Weight loss

Short duration of complaints

Diabetic ketoacidosis as first presentation

## DIAGNOSIS

- Diagnosis of diabetes: Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg%; post-glucose ≥ 200 mg%; HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (all to be re-confirmed); random glucose ≥ 200 mg% with symptoms
- Characteristic of T1 diabetes; urine/blood ketones: moderate-large (in &gt; 50%)
- Continuous requirement of insulin since diagnosis

## INVESTIGATIONS

HbA1c, creatinine, hemoglobin, TSH, tTG (tissue transglutaminase) antibody, lipid profile

## AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT

## NUTRITION

- Calories should be appropriate to the expected body weight, pubertal status, activity
- Balanced diet including all food groups
- Simple sugars and excessive fats to be avoided
- Meals/snacks to be individualized and reflect insulin schedule (usually 3 meals, 2 snacks)

## REGULAR EXERCISE

- Beneficial and should be encouraged

## EDUCATION

- Emphasize diabetes related education to patient and caregivers

## SMBG

- Check before each meal and at bedtime
- Should be checked more frequently in case A 1 c is not controlled, frequent hypoglycemia
- Glucose at midnight ( 1 2.00-2.00 am) occasionally to rule out nocturnal hypoglycemia
- Ketones should be checked if blood glucose is &gt; 250 mg/dl

## TARGET

- Pre-meal 801 30 mg%
- 2 hours post-meal: 1 201 80 mg%

## INSULIN TREATMENT

## Basal and bolus regimen

Insulin administration (0.25 to 1.0U/kg depending on age and pubertal status)

- Basal: glargine or detemir or NPH 40-50% of daily requirement

Insulin doses can be adjusted depending upon

∙Bolus: regular or rapid acting 50% of daily requirement/3 injections before each meal

1. Pre-meal and post-meal glucose level 2.Carbohydrates in the meal

3.Excercise pattern

## REASONS FOR REFERRAL TO HIGHER CENTRES

Uncontrolled hyperglycemia

## AT EVERY VISIT

- Growth &amp; pubertal development (for children and adolescents)
- Dietary and medication compliance
- BP, Weight monitoring
- Insulin site and injection technique
- Review SMBG record
- Hypoglycemia

## SICK DAY RULES/DKA

## IN CASE OF SICKNESS / INFECTION

- Measure glucose frequently, check for urine ketones if glucose &gt;250 mg%
- Drink plenty of fluids, monitor urine output
- Eat small light meals 4-5 times/day
- In addition to usual insulin doses, take extra regular insulin s.c. every 6 hourly (10-15% of total daily insulin dose)
- If glucose not falling, excess vomiting, low urine output, high or rising ketone, admit the patient

## DKA MANAGEMENT

- As per STW on Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

BP: Blood pressure

DKA:

Diabetic ketoacidosis

For education of patient &amp; family For insulin injection techniques/ SBGM/ identifying hypoglycemia s/s

Recurrent hypoglycemia

## MONITORING

## EVERY THREE MONTHS

- Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
- Target: &lt;7% (should be individualized)

Severe diabetic ketoacidosis (altered sensorium, rapid breathing)

Chronic diabetes specific

complications

## COMPLICATIONS &amp; COMORBIDITIES (5 YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS, THEN ANNUALLY)

- Fundus examination (Retinopathy)
- Foot examination (Neuropathy)
- Urine albumin/creatinine ratio
- Other investigations (S-creatinine, TSH), lipid profile

## HYPOGLYCAEMIA

- Symptoms and signs: Sweating, hunger, tremors, irritability, weakness, drowsiness / seizures / unconsciousness (late stage)
- Diagnosis: Mild / moderate: glucose &lt;70 mg% with or without symptoms
- Severe hypoglycemia: coma / seizures / inability to treat oneself
- Treatment: If glucose &lt;70 mg% take 3 tsf glucose powder or sugar; if severe: caregiver should give inj. glucagon 1 mg s.c./ i.m. OTHERWISE IMMEDIATELY take to hospital for intravenous glucose injection (1-2 ml/kg of 25% dextrose)
- Prevention: Identify mismatch of food, exercise, insulin
