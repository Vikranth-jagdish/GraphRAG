## title: ICMR GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018

## SECTION 10

## 10.1 Hypertension

Hypertension in patient with diabetes more than doubles the risk of morbidity and mortality from strokes and heart attacks. It is also one of the important correctable factors for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy. Hence it is essential that blood pressure should be checked on every visit and kept under control. A blood pressure (BP) more than 140/90 mm is the trigger to initiate treatment. Initial attempt should be made to control the BP by non-pharmacological measures. These include weight reduction, dietary modification by reducing salt intake and stress management (if possible).

A person with diabetes as well as with hypertension should be treated more aggressively than an individual with hypertension but without diabetes.

## 10.1.1 Blood pressure management and targets:

If blood pressure is &gt;140/90mm Hg Recheck after 1 week

If still high, drug therapy needs to be initiated with a single drug

1. ACE inhibitors /ARB (do not combine both) (or)
2. Calcium channel blockers
3. Selective beta blockers or diuretics (as a third line option if indicated)

If the blood pressure remains &gt;140/90 mm Hg after 1 month of monotherapy, add a second drug from a different class (do not combine ACEI and ARB). If BP is not controlled even with optimal doses of two agents, referral to a specialist is indicated. In patients with diabetic renal disease, even lower BP targets are recommended.

## 10.1.2 Severe hypertension:

If at initial visit, blood pressure is &gt; 180/110 mm Hg, or the patient has evidence of end organ damage, treatment should be initiated with two drugs initially and patient should be referred to a specialist as early as possible.

## 10.2. Dyslipidaemia

All patients with diabetes should be screened for dyslipidaemia and if present should be treated aggressively

## 10.3. Obesity

Weight reduction should be attempted in obese individuals with obesity. Lifestyle modification is the main stay of treatment and judiciously drugs may be used as an adjuvant. In morbid obesity, bariatric surgery may be an option.

## 10.4 Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in India. The prevalence of diabetes is high among people with TB in India and about 25% of TB patients were found to have diabetes and 24%, pre-diabetes. Diabetes is believed to elevate the risk of contracting TB by 2.5 to 3-fold. There should be a high index of suspicion for TB in all patients with diabetes. Wherever clinically indicated, initial evaluation of a patient with diabetes should include a chest X-ray.

Reducing morbidity and mortality due to TB and DM can be achieved through integrated approach of prevention, bidirectional screening for early detection in routine health care setting and management strategies through integration of services for TB and diabetes. Insulin is preferred if diabetes is uncontrolled or the TB is extensive.

## SUMMARY OF GUIDELINES

## 1. Screening and Diagnosis

- 1.1 All individuals aged 30 years and above should be screened for diabetes. Screening should be carried out at an earlier age in those with additional risk factors.
- 1.2 The oral glucose tolerance test is the diagnostic test of choice. Other options include fasting plasma glucose, random plasma glucose (in the presence of symptoms) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
- 1.3 The diagnosis of diabetes should be confirmed by a repeat test on a different day (unless there is unequivocal hyperglycemia).

## 2. Management of Hyperglycemia

- 2.1 Education regarding the disease and its management should be provided to all patients.
- 2.2 Lifestyle modification, including information on healthy dietary practices and sufficient physical activity, should be the first line of management.
- 2.3 Metformin is the initial pharamacotherapy of choice for most patients (unless specific contraindications or tolerance issues exist, or the patient has symptomatic hyperglycemia).
- 2.4 Sulphonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the preferred second line oral agents. Other alternatives include thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.
- 2.5 Consider triple oral therapy or initiation of insulin in patients not at target with dual therapy.
- 2.6 Most patients with type 2 diabetes should aim to keep their HbA1c below 7%. However, treatment targets need to be individualized.

## 3. Management of Complications and Comorbidities

- 3 .1 Comprehensive risk factor control should be attempted, aiming at achieving optimal levels of blood pressure and lipids, smoking cessation and weight reduction in addition to glycemic control.
- 3.2 Dilated retinal examination should be performed by a trained ophthalmologist at the time of first diagnosis of diabetes and at least annually thereafter.
- 3.3 Kidney function should be assessed at the time of diagnosis and at least annually thereafter by means of urine albumin-creatinine ratio and serum creatinine levels with calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
- 3.4 A comprehensive foot examination should be carried out at the time of first diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, focusing on detection of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease.

## 4. Diabetes in pregnancy

- 4 .1 All pregnant women should be screened for diabetes at the first antenatal visit.
- 4.2 Screening is ideally performed by means of an OGTT, utilizing thresholds suggested by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG). Alternatively, the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) criteria can be used if the woman is unable to come in the fasting state.
- 4.3 While lifestyle modification is the initial management option for women with gestational diabetes, most patients will need insulin. Oral antihyperglycemic agents are best avoided.
- 4.4 All women with gestational diabetes should undergo an OGTT 6 weeks after delivery to reclassify their glycemic status

## 5. Prevention of Diabetes

- 5.1 Prevention of diabetes can be carried out at primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary levels.
- 5.2 Individuals with pre-diabetes should receive education on intensive lifestyle modification so as to delay or prevent their progression to diabetes.
