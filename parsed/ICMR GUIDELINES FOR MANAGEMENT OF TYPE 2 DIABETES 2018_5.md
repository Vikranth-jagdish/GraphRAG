## title: ICMR GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018

## 8.4 Diabetic Nephropathy

## 8.4.1 Investigations:

- z Urine microscopy (Casts and pus cells, RBC)
- z Blood Urea, Serum creatinine
- z Calculate eGFR
- z Microalbuminuria
- z USG abdomen (if feasible)
- z Serum sodium and potassium

## 8.4.2 Management of albuminuria /proteinuria:

The algorithm given in the next page outlines the steps in investigation of albuminuria / proteinuria in a person with diabetes.

## 8.4.3 Treatment of hypertension in nephropathy:

- z Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are the drugs of choice (never combine both)
- z Others, if ACEIs or ARBs are not tolerated
- z Calcium channel blockers
- z Diuretics
- z Selective beta blockers (should be given in case of known previous acute coronary syndrome)

## 8.4.4 Refer the patient to nephrologist if:

- z Patient has severe/resistant hypertension
- z Patient has serum potassium &gt; 5.5 meq/L
- z Patient has nephrotic range proteinuria
- z Proteinuria is present in absence of retinopathy
- z Serum creatinine is &gt; 1.5 mg%
- z Any patient with pregestational diabetes or GDM with proteinuria
- z eGFR as calculated by MDRD is &lt; 60 ml/min
- z Presence of fluid overload or oliguria

Figure. 8.1 shows a suggested algorithm for the evaluation of proteinuria in a patient with diabetes. This will help differentiate proteinuria of diabetic and non-diabetic etiology.

## 8.5 Diabetic Retinopathy

Ninety percent of blindness from diabetic retinopathy (DR) is preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. All physicians dealing with diabetic retinopathy patients in large numbers must make an effort at recording visual acuity as an integral part of their work up and must strive to develop the skill of direct ophthalmoscopy. If visual acuity recording and retinal examination is not possible, all physicians must spend time educating their diabetic patients on the strong potential for diabetes to cause blindness, about how this can be prevented by regular visit to a retina specialist and about the need for an immediate baseline eye examination and blood glucose control. Recording of visual acuity and examination of the retina by ophthalmoscopy is mandatory in all diabetic patients. Whenever possible retinal photography must be obtained. If the services of a retina specialist are available, his / her opinion should be sought about the stage of retinopathy, any need for immediate / early treatment and about the next follow up visit. If services of a retina specialist are not available, then it is advised to compare retinal examination findings and/or findings on retinal photography with representative diabetic retinopathy images and corresponding management/ follow up guidelines or refer to the grades of diabetic retinopathy chart and advise patients accordingly.

- z Those patients who have a long history of diabetes, poor glycemic control, concurrent hypertension and nephropathy are more likely to have diabetic retinopathy
- z Pregnant women with diabetes also need frequent retinal examination as pregnancy may accelerate the development and progression of retinopathy
- z Visual acuity may be normal despite having diabetic retinopathy
- z However, when the visual acuity is found to be decreased in any patient with diabetes mellitus, it must be considered to be due to vision threatening diabetic retinopathy and the patient must be referred immediately to a retina specialist

## 8.5.1 Risk factors:

- z Long duration of diabetes
- z Poor glycemic control
- z Uncontrolled hypertension
- z Presence of diabetic nephropathy

## 8.5.2 General considerations:

- z Inform all patients that sight threatening eye disease is a common complication of diabetes
- z Severe diabetic retinopathy can be present even with good vision
- z Glasses testing/refraction should not be mistaken for retinal examination
- z Physicians should impress that it is mandatory to undergo a dilated retinal examination preferably by a trained retina specialist
- z Vision testing and (if possible) intraocular pressure testing should be done before retinal examination in all patients
- z Person with impaired vision (&lt; 6/60) should undergo low vision evaluation and rehabilitation
- z Person with diabetes should be screened for other causes of visual loss like cataract, glaucoma and macular degeneration

## 8.5.3 Screening recommendation for retinal examination \*:

| Patient Group   | When to screen first        | Routine follow-up   |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Type 1 diabetes | Within 5 years of diagnosis | Annually thereafter |
| Type 2 diabetes | At time of diagnosis        | Annually thereafter |

Pregnancy in pre-existing diabetes, retinal examination prior to conception and during pregnancy, refer to the ophthalmologist / retina specialist early in the first trimester

- Based on the findings during the fundus examination, subsequent follow up advice is provided.

## 8.6 Diabetic Neuropathy

## 8.6.1 Diagnosis &amp; clinical recognition:

- z Sensory neuropathy is evidenced by symptoms of paresthesiae (such as tingling, numbness and pain) or loss of sensation of touch, pain, temperature and vibration
- z Neuropathy can lead to foot deformities and dryness of plantar skin leading to neuropathic foot ulcers. These ulcers are susceptible for infection, cellulitis and osteomyelitis often requiring partial foot amputation
- z Motor weakness of small muscles of foot is evidenced by inability to grip footwear and alteration of arch of foot, bringing pressure on the head of first metatarsal and heel
- z Quadriceps wasting and absent knee jerk and bilateral hip muscle weakness suggest diabetic amyotrophy
- z Cranial motor neuropathy involving 3 rd , 6 th and rarely 7 th nerve must be considered in relevant cases
- z Radiculopathy and cranial neuropathies are reversible while sensorimotor symmetrical polyneuropathy is progressive and irreversible
- z Assess for autonomic neuropathy with symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, diarrhoea /constipation, impotence, cystopathy and gustatory sweating
- z Always exclude other causes of neuropathy for example nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, spinal disorders, paraneoplastic syndrome, drug induced, alcohol abuse, uremic neuropathies, etc.

## 8.6.2 Clinical examination:

- z For sensation as described under foot examination
- z Motor power assessment and tendon jerks
- z Examination of BP in sitting and standing positions and ECG for heart rate variability may be useful in diagnosing autonomic neuropathy

## 8.6.3 Investigations:

- z TSH
- z Vitamin B12 assay (if possible)
- z Paraproteinemias (if possible )

Refer atypical cases to a neurologist for further investigations like nerve conduction studies etc.

## 8.6.4 Treatment:

- z Tight glycemic control is essential. If there is painful peripheral neuropathy, drugs such as antiepileptics (gabapentin, pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (amitryptiline, imipramine), and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), (venlafaxine, duloxetine) are the first line medications. Either the maximum dose of each drug or a combination of two drugs must be tried to give relief. In resistant painful neuropathies use of second line drugs like opioids (tramadol) is also advised
- z If patient has symptoms and signs of numbness and loss of sensation, follow the guideline given under foot care to protect the foot from ulceration
- z Sexual dysfunction in males should be referred to specialists for appropriate therapy

## 8.7 Diabetic Foot

## 8.7.1 Diabetic foot screening:

This aims at categorizing feet into Low risk, At Risk or Active Foot Disease. Examination of a patient should include:

## 8.7.1.1. Foot inspection:

- z Inspection of skin, nails and for structural foot deformity
- z Examination of footwear

- z Record presence of:
- toe deformities like claw toes, hammer toe
- bunion
- high arch foot (pes cavus)
- Charcot foot

## 8.7.1.2. 10g monofilament sensation:

It delivers a 10 gram force when applied so as to make it buckle.

- z Apply the monofilament perpendicular to the skin's surface (see Figure 8.2.A below)
- z Apply sufficient force to cause the filament to bend or buckle (see Figure 8.2.B below)
- z The total duration of the approach, skin contact, and departure of the filament should be approximately 1- 2 seconds
- z Apply the filament along the perimeter and NOT ON an ulcer site, callus, scar or necrotic tissue. Do not allow the filament to slide across the skin or make repetitive contact at the test site
- z A person who cannot feel the 10 gram filament at the selected sites ( Figure 8.2.C ) is at increased risk for developing ulcers

Figure 8.2. The monofilament test

## 8.7.1.3. Vibration perception (128 Hz tuning fork):

Place the stem of the fork over the bony prominences of the foot (big toe and medial malleolus) and ask the patient if he feels the vibration. Record the result as absent, reduced or present depending on the patient's response. If absent, check at more proximal sites such as tibial tuberosity and anterior superior iliac spine.

## 8.7.1.4. Biothesiometer test:

The vibration perception threshold (VPT) is examined using a biothesiometer with the patient in the supine position with or without eyes closed.

## 8.7.1.5. Vascular assessment:

This involves the manual palpation of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in both feet. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) using hand held Doppler should be assessed if peripheral pulsations are absent or clinical suspicion of peripheral ischaemia (Normal ABI is between 0.9 to 1.3).

## 8.7.2. Risk categorization:

Risk categorization method for basic foot screening involves history of diabetesrelated foot complications, medical history, and assessment of peripheral sensation, arterial supply and presence of foot deformity ( Table 8.1 )

Table 8.1 Risk categories in diabetic foot

| Risk Category       | Clinical Features                                                                                                                                           | Frequency of assessment                             | Examiner                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low risk            | Normal foot pulses, normal vibration and sensation to 10g monofilament, no history of foot ulceration, no significant foot deformity, no visual impairment. | Annual                                              | Foot healthcare provider                                      |
| Moderate risk       | Reduction in vibration and monofilament sensation and/or absence of pedal pulses                                                                            | Annual or more frequently as required               | GP/foot health care provider, podiatrist and physiotherapist  |
| High risk           | Claudication / rest pain History of ulceration / Charcot neuroarthropathy                                                                                   | Every 6 months or more frequently as required       | GP/ foot health care provider, podiatrist and physiotherapist |
| Active foot disease | Ulceration, infection, suspicion of Charcot foot or ischaemia                                                                                               | At least once weekly or more frequently as required | Diabetes multidisciplinary footcare service                   |

(Note: those with previous history of foot ulcer, amputation or PVD need foot examination at every clinic visit or at least every 3 months)

## 8.7.3. General Principles of Management :

- z There is no need for a patient with low risk of diabetic foot disease to routinely see a podiatrist / physiotherapist for diabetes related purposes
- z All patients with diabetes should receive foot care education (See Do's and Don'ts Table 8.2 )
- z Risk factors like tobacco use should be controlled in every case
- z Patients with foot deformity that interferes with the function of the foot or the ability to obtain appropriate footwear should be referred for specialist assessment
- z Similarly, patients with absent pedal pulses should be referred for vascular assessment
- z If ulceration is present then refer within 24 hours to multidisciplinary foot care service
- z If there are clinical signs of infection, antibiotics should be commenced immediately. If there are clinical signs of severe/limb threatening infection, the patient should be admitted urgently for intravenous antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement or referred to appropriate higher centres

## 8.7.4. Foot care education:

All patients with diabetes should be educated on the do's and don'ts of foot care as listed in the Table 8.2 .

Table 8.2: Foot care - Do's and Don'ts for patients

| Do                                                      | Do not                                                                                   |

## SECTION 9 DIABETES AND PREGNANCY

## 9.1. Pre-gestational diabetes

Women with pre-existing diabetes, (e.g. type 2 or type 1 diabetes) who become pregnant are said to have pre-gestational diabetes. Maternal and fetal outcomes are good if the pregnancy is planned, preconception checkup done and tight glycemic control is achieved. The steps to achieve these are:

- z Tight glycemic control (preferably HbA1C (&lt; 6.5%) is ideal before a planned pregnancy
- z Folic acid supplementation should be given
- z Antihypertensive agents should be changed to calcium channel blockers or alpha methyldopa
- z ACEIs, ARBs, Diuretics and Statins should be discontinued
- z Pre-pregnancy baseline evaluation of eyes and kidney function must be done
- z Optimisation of nutritional status, anaemia and pre-pregnancy weight should be done
- z Maternal and fetal surveillance during pregnancy should ideally be done by an obstetrician and physician

## 9.2 Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)

Glucose intolerance of any severity detected for the first time during pregnancy is termed as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

## 9.2.1 Screening for gestational diabetes:

## 9.2.1a Indications:

Ideally all pregnant women in India should be screened for GDM i.e. universal screening. In case this is not possible, and only selective screening is done, at least the following women should be screened:

- z History of GDM
- z First degree relative with diabetes
- z Pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m 2 )
- z History of large weight babies (&gt;3.5kgs)
- z Bad obstetric history; - stillbirth, congenital anomalies, recurrent pregnancy loss, eclampsia, hydramnios
- z Repeated or persistent urinary tract infection
- z Glycosuria during pregnancy
- z Age above 25 years

However, if all these criteria are employed there will be very few women who are at low risk and do not need screening for GDM. Hence, it is better to try to screen all pregnant women for GDM.

## 9.2.1b Screening methods for GDM:

Screening for diabetes is ideally done at the first antenatal visit. Screening at the first trimester is mainly to rule out pre-existing diabetes. For this, fasting blood glucose or random blood glucose or HbA1C should be done. If the fasting glucose is ≥ 126 mg/dl or the random glucose is ≥200 mg/dl or HbA1C is ≥6.5%, it indicates pre-existing diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose between 92-125 mgs/dl at the first trimester screening is considered as GDM according to International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. At the second trimester,

screening for GDM is done usually between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) should be done using 75 gm glucose load using the IADPSG criteria (endorsed by WHO 2013 &amp; FIGO 2016). The following are the IADPSG glucose cut-offs for GDM:

| Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dl) | ≥ 92  |
| ------------------------------ | ----- |
| 1 hour (mg/dl)                 | ≥ 180 |
| 2 hour (mg/dl)                 | ≥ 153 |

If any one of the values is above these cut-offs, the woman is diagnosed to have GDM.

In situations where pregnant women cannot come in a fasting state and in resource limited settings, the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups of India (DIPSI) guidelines of non-fasting 75 gms single 2 Hr post glucose value ≥ 140 mg/dl can be used.

## 9.3. Management of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy

Exercise and medical nutritional therapy is the first step and initiated in all women with GDM. When this fails to achieve the target, medical management is initiated.

Insulin is the preferred drug of choice in diabetes and pregnancy. Currently most types of insulin are approved for use in pregnancy except Glargine, Glulisine and Degludec.

After the Metformin in GDM (MIG) study, many centres have started using metformin as first line in GDM. However more data are needed in Indians.

Besides glycemic control, fetal growth and maternal blood pressure need to be monitored.

## 9.3.1 Goals for therapy:

| Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dl)      | <90  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---- |
| 1 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) | <140 |
| 2 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) | <120 |

## 9.4 Post-partum follow up

As 50-70% of women with GDM go on to develop diabetes within 5-10 years after delivery, post partum screening for diabetes is necessary. A 2 hr OGTT using 75g glucose should be done 6-8 weeks after delivery for reclassification of diabetes as normal, pre-diabetes or diabetes. If normal, the testing should be repeated annually.
