For rectal carcinomas extending into gynaecologic or genitourinary structures, the external iliac region should be added.

## Nodal contouring:

A 7-8 mm margin in soft tissue around the external iliac vessels should be considered, but one should consider a larger (&gt;10 mm) margin anterolaterally, especially if small vessels or nodes are identified in this area.

The final CTV is created by fusing the various CTVs as described above.

## Boost volume:

Boost clinical target volumes extend to the entire mesorectum and presacral region at involved levels, including 2 cm cephalad and caudad in the mesorectum and 2 cm on the gross tumour within the anorectal canal.

## Planning target volume (PTV):

The CTV to PTV margin should be determined according to institutional preferences and experience (0.7-1.0 cm), depending on whether image-guided radiation therapy is being utilized.

## Normal structures:

1. Bladder
2. Bilateral femoral heads
3. Male external genitalia
4. Small and large bowel 1cm above and below the PTV

## Dose prescriptions:

45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks; 1 fraction daily prescribed to the PTV.

A 5.4 Gy boost in 3 fractions is optional for certain postoperative cases.

## (G) Conventional two-dimensional radiotherapy planning on a simulator

Patient positioning and immobilization: please refer to (A) and (B) above.

## Planning:

1. Mark the anal verge/APR scar using a copper wire
2. The source-to-axis distance technique is preferred for planning
3. A four-field box technique is used
4. The borders are as below:

Anteroposterior/posteroanteriorportal:

Upper border: L5-S1 junction

Lower border: Lower border of the obturator foramen

Lateral borders: 1.5 cm margin on the pelvic brim

Lateral portal:

Upper border: L5-S1 junction

Lower border: Lower border of the obturator foramen

Posterior border: Include the sacral hollow

Anterior border: Posterior border of the pubic symphysis

Corner shielding may be performed to save the bowel.

## Dose prescription:

45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks; 1 fraction daily prescribed to the isocentre.

A 5.4 Gy boost in 3 fractions is optional for certain postoperative cases.

## (H) Palliative radiation therapy planning for the pelvis:

## Planning:

1. Mark the lower most extent of disease using a copper wire
2. The source-to-axis distance technique is preferred for planning
3. A two-field technique is used
4. The borders are as below:

Anteroposterior/posteroanteriorportal:

Upper border: L5-S1 junction

Lower border: Lower border of the obturator foramen

Lateral borders: 1.5-cm margin on the pelvic brim

## Dose prescription:

20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions; 1 fraction daily prescribed to the isocentre.

## Appendix F: Performance Status

This is an assessment of overall fitness. It can be a useful guide regarding the ability to tolerate chemotherapy. The most commonly used scale is the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status:

0. Able to carry out all normal activity without restriction
1. Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out light work
2. Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out work; active for more than 50% of waking hours
3. Capable only of limited self-care; confined to the bed or chair for more than 50% of waking hours
4. Completely disabled; cannot carry out any self-care; completely confined to the bed or chair

Clinical trials will usually have their own performance status criteria for patient entry. Otherwise, chemotherapy should normally only be considered in those patients with performance status 0, 1, or 2.

## CHAPTER 14 SUMMARy

This consensus statement may be used as framework for more focused and planned research programmes to carry forward the process. The aim of the Indian Council of Medical Research Guidelines is to assist oncologists in making major clinical decisions encountered while managing their patients, while realizing the fact that some patients may require treatment strategies other than those suggested in these guidelines.

- Pattern of genomic alterations in colon and rectal tumours are similar, and hence, can be grouped · together.
- Histological confirmation is mandatory prior to the commencement of definitive treatment. ·
- All patients should be staged according to the TNM staging system and risk should be assessed at · diagnosis. A baseline contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be considered.
- Select cases should be referred to genetics clinics as described. ·
- Patients should receive multidisciplinary care under the care of a surgical, medical, and radiation · oncologist.
- Colon cancer (tumours lying above the peritoneal reflection):Primary surgery remains the standard of · care. The need for adjuvant chemotherapy should be determined on an individual basis. The option of observation alone versus chemotherapy should be discussed with the patient.
- Rectal cancer: Neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (NACTRT) should be strongly considered for locally · advanced but resectable tumours for disease downstaging and organ preservation.
- RAS · mutation testing may be performed for all patients with metastatic disease (desirable).
- Patients with liver-limited colorectal metastases should be referred early to a hepato-biliary surgeon · to assess resectability.
- First-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC): ·

5-Fluourouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as first-line treatment followed by single-agent irinotecan as second-line treatment or

FOLFOX as first-line treatment followed by 5-FU, LV, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as second-line treatment or

Capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPEOX) as first-line treatment followed by FOLFIRI as second-line treatment

FOLFIRI or capecitabine and irinotecan (CAPIRI) may also be given as first-line therapy

- Targeted therapy (cetuximab and bevacizumab) may be considered in select patients. ·
- Patients should be offered regular surveillance after completion of curative resection or treatment of · advanced disease.
- Participation in clinical trials should be encouraged. ·
- Referral for early palliative care should be made if indicated. ·
