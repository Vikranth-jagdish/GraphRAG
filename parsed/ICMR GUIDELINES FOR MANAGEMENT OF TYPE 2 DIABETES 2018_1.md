## FOREWORD

It gives me great pleasure to write Foreword for the 'ICMR GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018' Diabetes mellitus has become an epidemic the world over. Today is estimated that there are 425 million people in the world with diabetes: India has the second largest number of people with diabetes in the world. According to the IDF Atlas 8th Edition; there are 72 million people with diabetes in India. The ICMR INDIAB Study has provided valuable data on the prevalence of diabetes; state-wise, in almost all the states of India: It has also reported on the urban and rural prevalence of diabetes The study has shown that diabetes is no longer disease of older people; rich people or an urban phenomenon. has now started affecting the lower socio economic strata. Moreover, rural prevalence of diabetes is also increasing rapidly. More worrisome is the fact that the type 2 diabetes has now started affecting children and adolescents; to add to the already exiting problem of type diabetes which affects children and adolescents.

ICMR first brought out guidelines for treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2005. In the last decade; there have been numerous advances in the management of diabetes with several new forms of therapies which have now come to be established. In the light of this it was felt that the revised ICMR guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes needs to be developed Dr. V Mohan and Dr. Nikhil Tandon were given the task of developing these guidelines. The ICMR invited several experts from all over the country to contribute to this. After several iterations, meeting was then held at Chennai in January 10, 2018 to finalize the recommendations of the various experts . An initial document was prepared which was then put on the ICMR website for a few weeks to get additional inputs from doctors and scientists who may not have attended the expert committee meeting Based on all this, am happy to note that the 'ICMR GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018' is now ready. am sure this document will serve as useful for management of diabetes; not only to diabetologists and endocrinologists but also to general physicians and general practitioners , hope it will find place in various medical colleges so that undergraduate and postgraduates students may also be benefitted by this document guide

It is my wish that these guidelines are disseminated widely and thus help to improve the lives of millions of people not only in India but in neighboring countries as well.

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic disease. In addition; diabetes is risk factor for many common problems; including coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease; depression and functional disability . The prevalence of diabetes in adults 20 years or older in India increased from 5.5% in 1990 to 7-7% in 2016. The Indian Council of Medical Research formulated Guidelines for Management of Diabetes in 2005 . Keeping in view changing management practices over the years; the ICMR has now revised the Guidelines for Management of Diabetes (2018 with the experts working in this area. aged would like to express gratitude to Dr . Balram Bhargava; Secretary, Department of Health Research and Director General , Indian Council of Medical Research, for interest and understanding the need of formulating these guidelines taking special

This document is result of hard work of numerous experts working in area of Diabetes. The contribution of each member towards drafting of these guidelines deserves appreciation and We hope that this document would provide guidance to practicing doctors and researchers for the management of diabetes patients. is understood that this document represents the current thinking of national experts based on available evidencc Mention of and clinical tests do not imply endorsement or recommendation for their use These are only examples to clinicians in complex decision making: drugs guide would like to thank Dr RS Dhaliwal, Head, Division of Non communicable Diseases; for his support and coordination in finalizing this document would like to acknowledge the assistance provided by administrative staff.

It is hoped that these guidelines will help the practicing doctors to treat patients effectively and thus help them to lead a normal and healthy life.

would like to take this opportunity to thank the conveners-Dr. Nikhil Tandon; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi and Dr V Mohan; Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai in getting the members together, organizing the meetings and drafting the document:. The guidelines were further ratified by circulation to an extended group of researchers and practitioners drawn from all over the country . I therefore thank this large group of researchers who have also contributed in shaping up this document.

Dr. Tanvir Kaur Scientist 'F' Non Communicable Disease Indian Council of Medical Research

D iabetes has become a global problem and the epidemic is most pronounced in South East Asia particularly India where an estimated 72 million people are believed to have diabetes and another 80 million have pre-diabetes. More than 90 - 95% of all patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. The treatment of type 2 diabetes has undergone rapid changes in the last decade, and several new drugs have been introduced in the market.

In 2005, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) brought out the 'Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes' as a small book and this has found wide application all over India. As more than a decade has elapsed since the publication of that document, ICMR felt that a revision of the Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes was indicated. An expert group was constituted by ICMR, to look at the old guidelines and to suggest modifications as may be needed, based on the latest developments in the management of type 2 diabetes.

After several rounds of iteration, a document was prepared which was then circulated to a few additional experts. After getting the comments from these experts, an ICMR Workshop entitled 'ICMR GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018' was held at Chennai on 10th January 2018 and a group of experts was invited by ICMR. The Workshop was divided into different sections. Each part of the document was studied in detail and necessary changes were made to the document. The document was then placed in the ICMR website, giving an opportunity for anyone else who wished to view the documents and give their comments or suggestions to do so. A few additional suggestions were received which were also incorporated in the final document.

We now have great pleasure in publishing the 'ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 2018'. We trust that this booklet will be useful not only for practicing physicians and general practitioners but also for medical students (both undergraduates and postgraduates) and also for nurses, educators and other paramedical personnel. We welcome feedback and suggestions from readers so that when the next set of guidelines is prepared by ICMR, these suggestions can be incorporated.

We also wish to thank ICMR for their guidance and support and all the experts for the time and effort they spent in making this document. A special word of thanks to Dr. Ranjit Unnikrishnan who painstakingly compiled all the suggestions and comments and helped finalize the document.

## SECTION 1

## 1.1 Definition

Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome of multiple etiologies characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. This disorder is often associated with long term complications, involving organs like eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart and blood vessels.

## 1.2 Epidemiology

In recent decades, India has witnessed a rapidly exploding epidemic of diabetes. Indeed, India today has the second largest number of people with diabetes in the world. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that there are 72.9 million people with diabetes in India in 2017, which is projected to rise to 134.3 million by the year 2045. The prevalence of diabetes in urban India, especially in large metropolitan cities has increased from 2% in the 1970s to over 20% at present and the rural areas are also fast catching up.

## 1.3 Types of diabetes

According to the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organisation, diabetes can be classified into four main types (see Box) .

## Classification of Diabetes

- z Type 1 diabetes
- z Type 2 diabetes
- z Gestational diabetes
- z Other types of diabetes (Monogenic diabetes, pancreatic diabetes, drug-induced diabetes etc.)

Of these, the two most important forms of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is primarily due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency and thus requiring insulin for good health and survival. While type 1 diabetes is also on the increase, the actual numbers of people with type 1 diabetes in India is, relatively speaking, still small. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, accounts for over 90-95% of all people with diabetes and is characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion, either of which may predominate. The diabetes epidemic relates particularly to type 2 diabetes, and predominantly due to the changing lifestyles, urbanization, demography and increased longevity.

## 1.4 Differentiating Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes

Table 1.1 below provides a few clinical points to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Table 1.1 Points to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes

| Age at diagnosis                              | Usually childhood and adolescence, but can occur in adults as well | Usually postpubertal; most common in middle to later age groups |
| Diabetes in 1 st degree relative              | Unusual                                                            | Common                                                          |
| Severe osmotic symptoms/ Ketosis at diagnosis | Can occur                                                          | Rare                                                            |
| Markers of insulin resistance                 | Absent                                                             | Present                                                         |
| C-peptide assay                               | Absence of beta-cell reserve                                       | Preserved beta-cell reserve                                     |
| Pancreatic autoantibodies                     | Present                                                            | Absent                                                          |

Type 1 diabetes will not be discussed further in these guidelines and they pertain chiefly to type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic-cum-vascular syndrome characterized by predominant insulin resistance with varying degrees of insulin secretory defect. It is a progressive disease often associated with central obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. It is more common in overweight and obese individuals of middle to late age but is increasingly being seen in younger age groups and in those with lower body mass index (BMI) as well. The 'Asian Indian phenotype' refers to a peculiar constellation of abnormalities in south Asians, whereby for any given level of BMI, they tend to have higher total body fat, visceral fat, insulin resistance and prevalence of diabetes compared to white Caucasians ( Figure 1.1 ).

Figure 1.1: The 'Asian Indian phenotype'

## 1.5 Goals for management

- z Relief from symptoms of diabetes and improvement in quality of life
- z Glycemic control and prevention of acute complications
- z Identification and management of comorbid conditions like obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia
- z Prevention of microvascular complications like retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy
- z Prevention of macro-vascular complications like cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease
- z Prevention of infections

The complete treatment of people with diabetes requires advocating a healthy life style with focus on increased physical activity and a proper balanced diet in addition to prescribing medications.

## 1.6 Diabetes Education

Diabetes education means empowering people with diabetes with knowledge and providing tools crucial for making them active partners in the diabetes management team. These include: Lo

- z In-depth information about diabetes, its complications and treatment
- z Appropriate self care skills
- z Appropriate resources for self care
- z A positive attitude
- z Self monitoring skills

The compliance of people with diabetes is essential for effective management of diabetes. Education programmes are intended to help people to understand why these actions are so important and thereby increase their motivation for self-management.

## 1.7 Prevention of Diabetes

There is an urgent need for strategies to prevent or at least slow down the emerging epidemic of diabetes apart from treating diabetes and associated complications. Several factors are thought to contribute towards the acceleration of the epidemic, the most important being the rapid epidemiological transition due to urbanization and life style changes. Identifying individuals at risk is essential in planning preventive measures. Prevention of diabetes has several windows of opportunities ( Figure 1 . 2 ).

Figure 1.2: Levels of prevention of diabetes

The three stages of prevention are:

- 1.7.1 Primordial prevention attempts to reduce the risk factors for diabetes, e.g., reducing or preventing obesity to reduce the future risk of diabetes.
- 1.7.2 Primary prevention targets people who are in the stage of prediabetes to prevent the onset of diabetes. All people with prediabetes should be regularly screened and encouraged at each health care visit to pursue a healthy life-style, including a healthy diet, adequate exercise and weight control in order to prevent diabetes. Several studies including from India have shown that diabetes can be prevented in up to a third of people with prediabetes. When lifestyle alone is not sufficient and especially in those with combined IFG and IGT where progression to type 2 diabetes appear imminent, use of metformin in addition to lifestyle measures may be considered especially in Indians who progress rapidly to diabetes from the prediabetes stage.
- 1.7.3 Secondary prevention is to prevent the onset of complications in those who are already diagnosed to have diabetes. This can be achieved by meticulous control of diabetes with the help of diet, physical activity, life style modification and antihyperglycaemic drugs as indicated. Control should include holistic care beyond glycemic control i.e. attention to blood pressure, lipids etc.
- 1.7.4 Tertiary prevention of diabetes is aimed at limiting physical disability and rehabilitation measures in those who have already developed diabetic complications and preventing them from going into end stage complications of diabetes.
