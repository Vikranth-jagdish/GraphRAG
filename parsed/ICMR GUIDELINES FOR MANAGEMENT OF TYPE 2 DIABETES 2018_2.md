## SECTION 2

## SCREENING FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES

Type 2 diabetes occurs a much earlier age (at least a decade earlier) in Indians compared to other major ethnic groups. Screening of asymptomatic individuals allows diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes to be made at an earlier stage and thus appropriate management can be instituted. In addition, it provides an opportunity for screening of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and the institution of interventions for their control. Early detection of diabetes has been shown to improve outcomes.

## 2.1 Whom and when to screen?

Screening should be performed in all individuals &gt;30 years of age. It should be carried out at an earlier age in adults who have one or more of the following risk factors:

- z Family history of diabetes
- z Overweight/obese (BMI ≥23 kg/m 2 ) or have increased waist circumference (&gt;90 cm males, &gt;80 cm females)
- z History of hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg) or on treatment for hypertension
- z History of dyslipidaemia
- z Sedentary physical activity
- z History of gestational diabetes or macrosomia (birth weight &gt; 3.5 kg)
- z History of CVD (ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease)
- z History of polycystic ovarian syndrome and/or acanthosis nigricans

## 2.2 How to screen?

Screening can be done by fasting plasma glucose, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using 75 gm glucose or a random plasma glucose. Glycosylated (glycated) haemoglobin (HbA1c) is also recommended for screening; however, in India there are some limitations regarding its use.

## 2.3 Where to screen?

Preferably, screening should be done in a health care setting. Alternatively, community screening can also be done.

## 2.4 Retesting:

Retesting should be done after 3 years in case of normal glucose tolerance. In case of prediabetes, it should be done annually.

## 2.5 Other aspects:

CVD risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use and case of sedentary lifestyle should be identified and treated.

## SECTION 3

## 3.1 Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes

- z Symptoms of diabetes (see Section 3.2) plus casual or random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (Casual means without regard to time of last meal)
- z Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl\*
- z 2 hour post 75 g glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (as part of OGTT)\*
- z Glycated Haemoglobin ≥ 6.5%\*

\*Diabetes diagnosed using any of these criteria should be confirmed with another test subsequently.

## 3.2 Symptoms of Diabetes

- z Osmotic symptoms- polyuria, polydipsia
- z Weight loss in spite of polyphagia
- z Tiredness, weakness
- z Generalised pruritus
- z Recurrent urogenital infections
- z Delayed healing of wounds

More than half of all patients with diabetes will have no symptoms at all

## 3.3 Criteria for the Diagnosis of Prediabetes

The term 'prediabetes' refers to a situation where the blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to warrant a diagnosis of diabetes. Prediabetes consists of two entities viz. impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired gluose tolerance (IGT).

## DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

The diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes are summarized in Table 3.1

Table 3.1: Diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes

| Parameter               | Normoglycemia(mg/dl) | Normoglycemia(mg/dl) | Prediabetes (mg/dl) | Prediabetes (mg/dl) | Diabetes (mg/dl)                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |

- Individuals with random plasma glucose between 140-199mg/dl are recommended to undergo OGTT WHO - World Health Organisation; ADA-American Diabetes Association; IFG - Impaired Fasting Glucose; IGT - Impaired Glucose tolerance; FPG - Fasting Plasma Glucose; 2-h PG-2 hour post load Glucose test (oral glucose tolerance test) plasma glucose; HbA1c - Glycosylated Haemoglobin

## 3.4 Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)

- z Person to be tested should be on a normal diet (with at least 200 g carbohydrate/ day) for at least 3 days before the test
- z The test should be done after an overnight fast of 8-10 hours and comprises of two blood samples: fasting and 2 hours after glucose load
- z Following the collection of the fasting blood sample for analysis of plasma glucose, the individual should be administered 75 g of glucose (1.75 g/ kg body weight for children to a maximum of 75 g) dissolved in at least 250 ml of water. The glucose load should be drunk within a period of 5 minutes

The second sample should be collected 2 hours after the glucose load is given. The subject should be resting and refrain from smoking and eating in between the two sample collections.

## 3.5 Testing for Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents

Children and adolescents aged 18 years and below should be screened for diabetes if they are overweight (weight&gt;120% of ideal body weight) and have any of the following risk factors:

- z Family history of type 2 diabetes in first degree relatives
- z Signs of insulin resistance (Acanthosis nigricans)
- z Hypertension
- z Dyslipidaemia
- z Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

## SECTION 4

## TARGETS FOR CONTROL OF DIABETES

Any target is only a general guideline, and individualized targets are to be established. Tight glycemic control is essential in the early stages of diabetes, especially in the young to prevent complications. With the onset of complications and in the elderly, targets need to be revised based on the condition of the patient.

## 4.1 Targets for metabolic control in diabetes

Blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference and lipid targets for a patient with diabetes are listed in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 below.

Table 4.1: Targets for metabolic control in diabetes

|                                     | Ideal      | Satisfactory | Unsatisfactory |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dl)      | 80 -110    | 111 - 125    | > 125          |
| 2 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) | 120 - 140  | 141 - 180    | > 180          |
| Blood pressure (mm Hg)              | < 130/80   | < 140/90     | > 140/90       |
| Body Mass Index (kg/m 2 )           | 20 - 23    | 23.1 - 25    | > 25           |
| Waist (cm)                          | Men < 90   |              |                |
| Waist (cm)                          | Women < 80 |              |                |
| Glycated Haemoglobin [HbAlc] (%)    | < 7        | 7 - < 8      | 8              |

Table 4.2 Targets for lipid control in diabetes

| Total Cholesterol (mg/dl)  | < 200                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| HDL Cholesterol (mg/dl)    | > 40 for men > 50 for women |
| LDL Cholesterol (mg/dl)    | < 100\*                     |
| Non-HDL Cholesterol(mg/dl) | <130                        |
| Triglycerides (mg/dl)      | <150                        |

\*For those at high risk (established CVD, smoking, obesity, hypertension, family history of premature CVD and evidence of other vascular disease), LDL cholesterol &lt;70mg/dl is recommended

## 4.2. Glycemic targets during pregnancy

Tight glycemic control is most essential during pregnancy. Glycemic targets during pregnancy are presented in Table 4.3.

Table 4.3: Glycemic targets during pregnancy

|                                     | Ideal |
| ----------------------------------- | ----- |
| Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dl)      | <90   |
| 1 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) | <140  |
| 2 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) | <120  |

Physician may request for either for a 1 hour or 2 hour postprandial blood glucose value for purposes of monitoring.

## SECTION 5 MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES

## 5.1 How to Monitor and Follow up People with Diabetes?

- z Blood glucose - FPG and 2 hr PPPG at least once a month and more often if values are not in the ideal target range
- z HbA1c at least every 6-12 months and more often (every 3 months) if values are not in the ideal target range, or tight control is being attempted
- z Clinical examination needs to be done during every visit--- minimum every 3 months
- z Screening for long term complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) at least once a year, more often if needed (see Section 8)
- z Optimizing weight, waist, blood pressure, lipids
- z Routine examination of foot to be done during every visit &amp; education regarding foot care to be given to patients in each visit
- z Discourage tobacco use and excess use of alcohol

Urine glucose monitoring is not recommended. Urine examination for estimation of ketones should be done if blood glucose is greater than 400 mg/dl.

## 5.2 Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) with Glucose Monitor

It is indicated in the following conditions:

- z Ideal for every patient to achieve better control of diabetes
- z All people with diabetes on insulin
- z Brittle diabetes
- z Those prone to ketosis/recurrent hypoglycaemia
- z Hypoglycaemia unawareness

- z Whenever tight control is indicated - pregnancy, acute illness and complications
- z Frequency of SMBG should be individualised (e.g. with greater frequency in pregnancy)

## 5.3 What to do during Annual Check-Up?

- z Basic clinical exam including detailed foot exam with palpation of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, monofilament and vibration perception testing (VPT) (See Section 8)
- z Retinal check-up (fundus examination for retinopathy)
- z Blood urea / serum creatinine
- z Urine - protein/albumin, micro-albuminuria if available or at least Urinary Albumin by dipstick
- z ECG
- z Lipids
- z Hemogram
- z Urine routine
- z Diet/ exercise to be reinforced
- z Psychological support whenever necessary
- z Tests to be carried out when indicated: X Ray chest, uric acid, TSH, SGOT, SGPT, vitamin B12, electrolytes, ultrasound abdomen

Advanced monitoring can be done if required in case of recurrent hypoglycaemia, severe fluctuations in blood glucose, disparity in measured glucose values and HbA1c, severe anaemia, haemoglobinopathy, hypoglycaemia unawareness etc. Here Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for 5-7 days or iSCGM (intermittently scanned CGM) for 14 days may be used.

## SECTION 6

## NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES

## 6.1. Lifestyle Goals in Diabetes

- z To improve health through optimum nutrition
- z To provide energy for reasonable body weight , normal growth and development
- z To maintain glycemic control
- z To achieve optimum blood lipid levels
- z To individualise the diet according to complications and co-morbidities
- z Achieve optimal physical activity
- z Advise other behavioural changes for: smoking, other tobacco products and alcohol
- z Advocate stress management
- 6.2 Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for diabetes mellitus requires application of nutritional and behavioral sciences along with physical activity.

We need a four-pronged approach:

- z Nutritional assessment which includes metabolic, nutritional and life style parameters
- z Setting goals -practical, achievable and acceptable to the patient-individualised
- z Nutritional Intervention, including nutrition education - individualized meal plans according to family eating patterns
- z Evaluation - to assess if the goals have been achieved and to make necessary changes

Based on factors like age, sex, physical activity, height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and cultural factors, the diet is planned. The diet should be individualized, close to the family pattern, flexible, should have variety and meal timing should be according to the patient's daily schedule.

## 6.2.1 Dietary Recommendations:

## (i) Energy:

Sufficient to attain or maintain a reasonable body weight for adults, normal growth and development for children and adolescents, to meet the increased needs during pregnancy and lactation and recovery from illness. Daily physical activity and exercise needs to be considered.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Approximately, 25 kcals/kg ideal body weight/day can be given to a moderately active patient with diabetes. The change in the daily calorie should be a gradual process, and not more than 500 calories/day.

## (ii) Energy or Calorie Distribution:

## (a) Carbohydrates:

Evidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes. Therefore, collaborative goals should be developed for individuals with diabetes. 55-60 % of energy from carbohydrates is an ideal recommendation. Carbohydrates should be complex in nature. Although different carbohydrates produce different glycemic responses, from clinical point of view it is important to manage total carbohydrate. It is recommended that carbohydrates from foods high in fibre e.g. whole grains (unpolished cereals and millets), legumes, peas, beans, oats, barley and some fruits with low glycemic index and glycemic load are consumed. All patients with diabetes should be encouraged to take 6 small meals a day. Food exchange system can be followed to give more variety and individualization to the diet plan.

## (a) Fibre:

Fibre recommendation for general population is 40 g/day (2000 Kcals).

Traditional Indian diets that include whole grains along with whole pulses like grams, soy, green leafy vegetables and some fruits is the recommendation. Fruits like papaya, guava, apples, pears, oranges, mosambi can be taken in moderation. All fruit juices are best avoided.

## (b) Proteins:

Proteins should provide 12-15 % of the total energy intake for people with diabetes similar to the recommendations for the general population.

Proteins from vegetable sources like pulses, soy, grams, peas as well as form low fat milk, low fat curds, fish and lean meats are recommended.

Supplementation of foods like cereal and pulse (4:1 ratio) can improve the protein quality and also gives satiety. For e.g; Idli, dosa, Missi roti, Khichdi, Dhokla, Khandvi etc.

## (c) Fats:

Fats should provide 20-30 % of total energy intake for people with diabetes.

Evidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of total fat intake for people with diabetes, therefore, goals should be individualized. Fat quality is as important as the quantity.

## Fat quality

- z Saturated fats (SFA) ≤10% energy and 7% in those with raised blood lipid levels

- z Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) 10 % energy, n6: 3-7% energy, n3: &gt;1% energy, n6/n3 ratio 5-10
- z Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA) 10-15% energy + any calories left from the carbohydrate portion
- z Trans fats &lt; 1% energy - preferably totally avoided

In people with type 2 diabetes, MUFA-rich cooking oil and nuts in moderation may benefit glycemic control and CVD risk factors. This can therefore be recommended as an effective alternative to a lower-fat, higher-carbohydrate eating pattern. Use of MUFA rich oils like mustard, rice bran, peanut (groundnut) and gingelly are good options. Oils rich in n6 PUFA like safflower, sunflower, cotton seed, should be mixed with oils rich in n3 like soy and mustard to maintain N6:N3 ratio between 5-10. Use of mixed oils or alternating of oils is recommended.

## (iii) Salt:

Sodium intake recommendations for people with diabetes are the same as that for the general population. Added (iodized) salt should be less than 5 g/day. For persons with hypertension and diabetes, the intake should be reduced to less than 3 g/ day. In hypertensive patients or edematous patients with nephropathy, sodium restriction is required. All preserved and processed foods such as pickles, chutneys, packaged namkeens/savouries, sauces should be restricted.

## (iv) Alcohol:

It is best to avoid alcohol, however if used, should be taken in moderation. If alcohol is consumed, it should not be counted as part of the meal plan. However, it should be borne in mind that alcohol does provide calories (7 kcal/ g), which are considered as 'empty calories'. In the fasting state, alcohol may produce hypoglycaemia. Alcohol can further exacerbate fatty liver, neuropathy, dyslipidaemia, obesity and also worsen blood glucose levels.

## (v) Sweeteners:

Nutritive Sweeteners : These include fructose, honey, corn syrup, molasses, fruit juice or fruit juice concentrates dextrose, maltose, mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol.. All these are best avoided.

Non-nutritive Sweeteners : Aspartame, acesulfame K, stevia, sucralose and saccharin are currently approved for use. However, they should be used in moderation and are best avoided in pregnancy.

## 6.2.2 Dietary modifications in the presence of complications of diabetes:

## (i) Nephropathy:

- (a) Protein : The recommended protein intake for diabetic nephropathy patients is 0.6 g/kg of the ideal body weight plus 24 hour urinary protein loss, if this is significant. However, it is recommended that the protein intake should not be less than 40 g/ day. For patients with increased creatinine, protein restriction should be advised in consultation with the nephrologist.
- (b) Sodium: It could vary from 1000 mg to 2000 mg/day depending upon the fluid status and serum sodium levels.
- (c) Potassium: Potassium restriction may be required depending upon the potassium values in the blood and type of diuretic being used.

## (ii) Cardiovascular Disease:

- (a) Maintaining an optimal body weight and restricting salt. Use of fruits and vegetables should be encouraged, with good quality fats in moderation.
- (b) Dyslipidaemia : Saturated and trans fats food sources like vanaspati, butter, ghee, margarine, coconut oil, red meats like sausages, ham, bacon, egg yellow, whole milk and its products should be restricted. Use of healthy oils and fibre rich foods is

recommended. Vegetarians can take flax seeds (10 g / day) in their diet as both fish and flax seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which is protective for heart disease. Alcohol restriction will bring down the triglycerides. Dietary management should be accompanied with regular physical activity and exercise regimen.

## 6.2.3 Special situations requiring dietary modification:

## (i) Sick Days

In the event of fever or other illness, the diabetic diet should be modified by changing the consistency and texture of foods to maintain adequate calorie intake. Semi solid foods and fluids or items like thin soups, milk, buttermilk, or fresh lime juice should be encouraged.

## 6.2.4 Lifestyle Management:

## (i) Tobacco:

Smoking and tobacco chewing is totally prohibited.

## (ii) Stress:

Stress management is essential which could take the form of meditation, yoga, a long outdoor walk, exercise and trying out hobbies like reading, gardening, painting etc. Practice of yoga is our traditional Indian system, which has therapeutic value in controlling our physical and mental health. It should be done under the guidance of an expert.

## 6.3 Physical Activity and Exercise

Regular physical activity along with regulated exercise is an essential component of management of type 2 diabetes. Complete evaluation of patients with diabetes should be performed before recommending an exercise program. The exercise programme has to be individualized according to one's ability and individual capacity.
