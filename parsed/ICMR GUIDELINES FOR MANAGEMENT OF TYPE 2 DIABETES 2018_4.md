Legend: SU- Sulfphonylureas; DPP4i- Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (Gliptins); GLP-1RA- Glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists; TZD- Thiazolidinediones (Glitazones); AGI- Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor; Glinide- Non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogue (Repaglinide and Nateglinide); SGLT2i- Sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor

- with or without oral agents

** If metformin is contraindicated, monotherapy can be initiated with any of the other classes of oral agents \*** Monitor for continued efficacy of drug as well as for development of side-effects

- z In practice, majority of patients will require pharmacotherapy at time of diagnosis along with lifestyle modification
- z If the initial blood glucose levels are very high, the symptoms are very severe or acute complications like ketosis are present, insulin should be considered even at the onset at least for a brief period for early achievement of euglycemia
- z If the initial assessment shows presence of complications like diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy, this indicates a long period of undiagnosed diabetes and insulin therapy on a continuous basis should be considered
- z With increasing duration of diabetes, most oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents tend to become less effective and hence poly-pharmacy becomes inevitable, with use of drugs from multiple classes. However, insulin use should not be delayed and whenever necessary, insulin should be introduced for tight glycemic control

## 7.1.10 Combination of oral drugs with insulin:

When glycemic control is not achieved with the maximum tolerable dose of a single oral agent or combination of oral drugs, combination of oral drugs and insulin can help to achieve good control of diabetes. Oral drugs may be continued in optimal doses, while intermediate acting/long acting/short acting insulin is added either at bedtime or in the morning depending on the blood glucose profile of the patient. When premixed or multiple dose insulin is given, consideration may be given to reducing the dose of secretagogues or stopping them altogether.

## 7.1.11 Use of Indigenous Drugs:

Many people with diabetes in our country use indigenous drugs from other systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani etc. Several herbal products have been advocated for the treatment of diabetes such as Pterocarpus marsupium, Gymnema sylvestre, Mormordica chirantica, Eugenia jambolana etc. These drugs by themselves or in combination, do have blood glucose lowering effects. Their exact mechanism of action is still not clear. There is a common belief that all herbal drugs are safe and non-toxic which is not necessarily true.

In view of the widespread use of these indigenous medicines, physicians should be aware of the herb-drug interactions. There is ample scope for research and careful evaluation of these agents needs to be done in the management of diabetes.

## 7.2 Insulin therapy

Insulin is the mainstay of therapy in type 1 diabetes. However, many patients with type 2 diabetes will also require insulin injections to help them achieve their glycemic targets.

## 7.2.1 Indications for the use of insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus at the time of diagnosis:

- z Person with diabetes with significant, symptomatic hyperglycaemia, loss of weight and polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia
- z Fasting plasma glucose &gt; 270 mg/dl or HbA1c &gt;9%
- z Severe infections
- z Presence of ketosis

## 7.2.2 Other situations where insulin is indicated:

- z Patients not responding to optimal doses of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents alone or in combination
- z Acute hyperglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis / hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state / lactic acidosis
- z Stressful situations such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute infections, tuberculosis\*,trauma and other conditions requiring hospitalisation
- z Pregnancy and lactation
- z Peri-operative state
- z Intolerant / contraindications to OHA

- z Hepatic and renal failure
- z Renal transplantation - Oral agents can be used
- z Person with diabetes on steroids

* Decision left to discretion of treating physician

## 7.2.3 Types of insulin preparations:

Different types of insulin are available. They have different pharmacokinetic properties. Insulin type, injection technique, insulin antibodies, site of injection and individual patient response differences can affect the onset, degree and duration of insulin activity.

Human insulin manufactured by rDNA technology and insulin analogues are the only insulins available at present. Animal insulin is no longer available.

## (i) Human insulin:

- z Short acting - human soluble insulin (regular)
- z Intermediate acting - neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)
- z Premixed- mixtures of regular and NPH insulin in 25/75, 30/70, 50/50 proportion

## (ii) Insulin Analogues:

- z Rapid acting (e.g. Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine)
- z Long acting (Glargine, Degludec, Detemir)
- z Premixed Insulin analogue (Lispro/ lispro protamine, aspart/ aspart protamine)
- z Co-formulations (Degludec + Aspart insulin)

Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a soluble formulation of the novel basal analogue insulin degludec(70%) and insulin aspart (IAsp: 30%)

## 7.2.4 Insulin action profiles (Figure 7.4) :

Figure 7.4: Insulin Profiles After Subcutaneous Injections

## 7.2.5 Storage of insulin:

- z Insulin not in use should be refrigerated in the lower compartment of the door of the refrigerator. It should not be kept in the freezer compartment. Ideal storage temperature is 2-8° C
- z Insulin should not be exposed to direct sunlight / heat
- z Excess agitation should be avoided to prevent loss of potency, clumping, frosting or precipitation
- z If refrigeration is not available, insulin should be stored in a cool place - e.g., in an earthenware pot of water (inside a plastic bag)
- z If regular insulin shows haziness, it should not be used. If cloudy insulin cannot be re-suspended, it should not be used

## 7.2.6 Mixing of insulin :

- z Administration of mixtures of short and intermediate insulin will produce better glycemic control than use of single insulin in some patients
- z Regular and NPH insulin can be mixed but must be injected immediately after mixing

## Sequence of mixing insulin is shown in Figure 7.5

Figure 7.5: Procedure for mixing insulin

- z Before each injection, the hands and the injection site should be cleaned
- z The top of the insulin vial should be wiped with spirit
- z For cloudy insulin preparations (NPH and human and analogue premixes), the vial should be gently rolled in the palms of the hands (not shaken) to re-suspend the insulin
- z An amount of air equal to the dose of insulin required should first be drawn up and injected into the vial to avoid creating a vacuum
- z For a mixed dose, putting sufficient air into both bottles before drawing up the dose is important
- z In case, insulin has to be mixed in the same syringe (the mixing of rapid or short acting insulin with NPH), the clear rapid or short acting insulin should be drawn into the syringe first

## 7.2.7 Use of syringes:

- z Conventional insulin administration involves subcutaneous injection with syringes marked in insulin units
- z There may be differences in the way units are indicated (U-40, U-100) and in India, both are available in 1 ml syringe. Fixed needle (single unit) syringes are desirable
- z It is important to make sure that there is no syringe-vial mismatch as far as insulin concentration is concerned e.g. U-40 syringe must be used only for U-40 insulin
- z Syringes and needles must never be shared with another person
- z If reuse is planned, the needle must be carefully recapped after each use. The needle should not be wiped or washed
- z Change needles after 3-4 uses, otherwise there is a risk of needle getting infected

## 7.2.8 Insulin administration:

## (i) Insulin pens:

- z Several pen-like devices and insulin containing cartridges are available that deliver insulin subcutaneously through a needle
- z They are easy to use

## (ii) Insulin pumps:

- z Insulin pump for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is available in India with integrated algorithm, which can automatically stop release of insulin thirty minutes before onset of hypoglycemia. It is indicated for those with brittle diabetes, multiple dose injections and recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia
- z Its use may be restricted to diabetes specialists with relevant experience

The main problems associated with insulin use are hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Weight gain can be significant and is generally well correlated with the total daily dose of insulin. Used needles must be disposed off in a bio-safe manner. For initiating insulin, it is not necessary to hospitalize the patient. It can be done on outpatient basis.

## Insulin colour coding:

Grey - Intermediate

Yellow - regular insulin

Green - NPH

Brown - Premix insulin

## (iii) Injection procedure (Figure 7.6):

- z Injections are given into the subcutaneous tissue
- z Inject insulin by lifting up a fold of skin and inject at a 90° ° angle
- z Thin individuals or children may need to pinch the skin and inject at a 45° angle to avoid intramuscular injection, especially in the thigh area

2. Push the needle through the skin at 900 keeping thumb away from dosage button

- 3.Push thumb button plunger down completely and count to 10 or follow manufactures recommendations.

## (iv) Injection site:

- z Insulin may be injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm, the anterior and lateral aspects of the thigh, the buttocks and the abdomen. For self injection, abdomen and thigh are the convenient sites
- z Rotation of the injection site is important to prevent lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy. Rotating within one area is recommended (e.g. rotating injections systematically within the abdomen) rather than rotating to a different area with each injection. This practice may decrease variability in absorption from day to day
- z Site selection should take into consideration the variable absorption between sites. The abdomen has the fastest rate of absorption followed by the arms, thighs and buttocks
- z Exercise increases the rate of absorption from the injection sites
- z The most commonly recommended interval between injection of short acting (regular) / premixed insulin and a meal is 30 min. However, insulin analogues can be given along with or even after a meal

## (v) Adverse effects associated with insulin use:

- z The main problems associated with insulin use are hypoglycaemia and weight gain
- z Weight gain can be significant and is generally well correlated with the total daily dose of insulin

## (vi) Disposal of needles:

- z Used needles must be disposed of in a bio-safe manner. Used sharps should be collected in a strong cardboard/ glass container, sealed and labelled and handed over to the nearest healthcare facility

## (vii) Initiation of insulin:

- z For initiating insulin, it is not necessary to hospitalize the patient. It can be done on outpatient basis
- z The dose has to be individualized depending upon the blood glucose profile and clinical setting
- z It is better to start with small doses and modify as needed every three days
- z Generally, the starting dose of insulin should be 0.2 units/kg/day

## (viii) Adding insulin to oral antihyperglycaemic agents:

When combinations of oral antihyperglycaemic agents no longer maintain the level of control desired, insulin is needed ( see Section 7.1 )

## (ix) Multiple insulin injections:

- z When a single insulin injection plus one or more oral agents no longer maintains good glucose control, two or more injections are needed
- z A regimen containing mixtures of NPH and regular insulin mixed in different ratios (e.g. 25:75, 30:70, 50:50) either mixed by the individual or premixed, taken before breakfast and dinner is a reasonable way to start multiple injections
- z Older persons need careful monitoring to avoid hypoglycaemia

## 7.3 Non-insulin injectable therapy (GLP-1 receptor agonists)

The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are secreted from the gut in response to a meal and bring about glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas and suppression of glucagon release from the alpha cells. The GLP-1 receptor analogues currently available are resistant to degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme and hence have longer half-lives than native GLP-1. The main advantages of these agents are that they reduce hyperglycaemia with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia and also promote weight loss. The main side effects are nausea and vomiting; a few cases of acute pancreatitis have also been reported. They can be combined with all other classes of anti-hyperglycaemic agents except the DPP-4 inhibitors. There is some evidence that these agents improve cardiovascular outcomes over and beyond their effects on blood glucose. Exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide and dulaglutide are the GLP-1 receptor agonists available in India at present (Table 7.2). They can be taken at any time of day, but preferably at the same time every day.

## SECTION 8

## COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES

Most of the morbidity and mortality due to diabetes arises on account of its complications. Diabetes complications can be broadly divided into acute and chronic complications. Acute complications include hypo- and hyperglycaemic emergencies whereas chronic complications include microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy), macrovascular disease (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease) and diabetic foot.

## 8.1 Acute Complications

## 8.1.1 Hypoglycaemia:

It is a common side effect due to drug therapy of diabetes especially sulphonylureas and insulin. The patient may have classical symptoms like hunger, sweating, tremors, palpitation with or without loss of consciousness.

## Steps to be taken:

- z If glucose monitor is available, random plasma glucose should be estimated
- z If glucose monitor is not available and patient is conscious, he should be treated with oral glucose/ sweets/sugar
- z If patient is brought in unconscious state, give 25-50 ml of 25% dextrose IV
- z If there is inadequate response, maintain a 5% dextrose drip and refer to hospital immediately
- z If recurrent hypoglycaemia persists, check for renal function and hypothyroidism

## 8.1.2 Hyperglycaemic emergencies (Diabetic Ketoacidosis- DKA or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State- HHS):

Usually such emergencies occur in situations like infections or other stressful conditions. There is usual history of missed dose of insulin or poor control of diabetes. DKA is characterized by abdominal pain and is manifested with breathlessness, vomiting, altered sensorium and dehydration. The symptoms of HHS are predominantly neurological; dehydration is usually more profound but abdominal pain is uncommon.

## Steps to be taken:

- z Monitor glucose levels
- z Check for urine ketones
- z Intravenous saline infusion at 1 litre in half hour should be started immediately and refer to hospital

## 8.2 Chronic Complications

Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disorder, which potentially can cause serious organ damage involving eyes, heart, kidney, nerves and limbs, which ultimately can lead to blindness, heart attack, kidney failure and limb amputation respectively. If diagnosed early and treated in time appropriately, the damage to some of these organs can be largely prevented or reversed. Another important issue is that most complications cause clinical symptoms only at a very late stage and thus for their early diagnosis, these complications have to be specifically looked for even at the time of prediabetes. Considering this, the following approach is advisable for management of people with type 2 diabetes.

On the first clinic visit detailed history and a thorough examination with preliminary tests are essential. Additional investigations may be necessary if there are high risk factors in the patient and/or there is any abnormality in history, examination and preliminary investigations. At that stage, these patients need to be referred to specialists for further management.

## 8.2.1 History:

## 8.2.1.1 Present history:

- z Has the patient any specific symptoms related to organ involvement that have brought him/her to the doctor?
- z Duration of diabetes
- z Medications and doses
- z Compliance with medication and life style measures
- z Latest blood glucose, HbA1C and other lab reports available
- z Referral to retinal specialist is mandatory if one is unable to do a retinal exam

## 8.2.1.2 Past history:

- z Hypertension
- z Heart disease
- z Known kidney disease
- z Tuberculosis
- z Eye problem including history of laser treatment / therapy
- z Surgery, past history of non-healing ulcer and / or amputation

## 8.2.1.3 Personal history:

- z Smoking and tobacco use
- z Alcohol intake
- z Dietary habits
- z Exercise regimen

## 8.2.1.4 Family history:

- z Diabetes and diabetic complications
- z Hypertension
- z Kidney diseases

- z Stroke
- z Coronary artery disease

## 8.2.2 Examination:

- z Blood pressure (sitting and standing)
- z CVS examination-heart sounds, murmurs
- z Other systemic examinations -respiratory, neurology, abdomen, musculoskeletal etc.
- z Peripheral pulses/carotid pulses
- z Pedal edema
- z Complete foot examination (ref page 45)

## 8.2.2.1 Eye examination:

- z Visual acuity
- z Intra Ocular Pressure (if possible)
- z Retinal examination including fundus examination after dilatation (ophthalmoscopy)
- z Cataract

## 8.2.3 Investigations:

- z These are detailed under each complication
- z In selected cases, X-ray chest may also be indicated

## 8.3 Coronary Artery Disease

- z When patient is asymptomatic with abnormal E.C.G, refer to specialist / physician / cardiologist
- z If the symptoms suggest suspicion of unstable angina / acute myocardial infarction (MI) , give aspirin (300 mg to be chewed) and statin (e.g. Atorvastatin 80 mg) and refer to nearest hospital urgently
