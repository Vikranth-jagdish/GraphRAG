## Symptoms

- Osmotic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia)
- May be asymptomatic
- Weight loss
- Non-healing wounds
- Paraesthesia
- Recurrent infections
- Blurring of vision

---

## Examination

- BMI
- Waist circumference
- BP
- Peripheral pulses
- Hypertension, Dyslipidaemia, CAD, CKD
- Skin, oral cavity, foot
- Fundus (dilated) examination

---

## Investigations

- HbA1c
- Creatinine, K+
- Fasting lipid profile
- Urine routine + spot albumin:creatinine ratio\*  
  \* Best after initial glycaemic control
- LFT/ALT, AST
- ECG
- Others as indicated (Echo, USG abdomen)

---

## Metabolic Targets

- HbA1c ≤ 7% (higher acceptable in elderly/significant comorbidities)
- Pre-prandial glucose: 80–130 mg/dl
- Post-prandial glucose: <180 mg/dl
- BP: ≤140/90 mmHg (≤130/80 in CKD)
- LDL: <100 mg/dl (<70 mg/dl in CAD)

---

## Treatment

### Lifestyle

- Dietary modification
- Avoid tobacco
- Restrict/avoid alcohol
- Physical activity

### Pharmacotherapy (based on HbA1c)

- HbA1c < 8.5% → Metformin monotherapy
- HbA1c 8.5–10% → Dual therapy (Metformin + SU/TZD/DPPIVi/SGLT2i/AGI/GLP-1RA)
- HbA1c > 10% → Basal insulin + Metformin + another OAD / triple OAD

---

## Screening

### In Pregnancy

- H/O GDM or pre-existing diabetes
- Screen all pregnant women 1st trimester (FPG)
- FPG ≥126 or HbA1c ≥6.5% → pre-existing diabetes
- FPG 92–125 → GDM
- If normal in 1st trimester → 75g OGTT at 24–28 weeks
- GDM women: test 6 weeks postpartum & every 3 years
- Prediabetes: test yearly

### In Apparently Normal Adults

- Overweight/obese (BMI ≥23–27.5) + risk factors (family history, CVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, PCOS, insulin resistance, physical inactivity, >30 yrs, history of GDM)

### In Adults with Illness

- Osmotic symptoms
- Unexplained weight loss, depression, dementia
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Deep infections (TB, pneumonia, abscess, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis)
- Recurrent infections (tinea, thrush, UTI, cellulitis, STIs, etc.)
- Non-healing ulcers
- Exogenous/iatrogenic Cushing’s

---

## Diagnostic Criteria

- FPG ≥126 mg/dl (after 8h fasting)
- 2h PG ≥200 mg/dl during OGTT
- HbA1c ≥6.5%
- Symptoms + random PG ≥200 mg/dl

### Prediabetes

- FPG: 100–125 mg/dl
- OGTT: 140–199 mg/dl
- HbA1c: 5.7–6.4%

---

## Monitoring

- FPG + 2h PPG once monthly (more frequent if required, including SMBG/CGM)
- HbA1c every 6–12 months (3-monthly if uncontrolled)
- Annual: ECG, urine ACR, fundoscopy, foot exam

---

## Referrals

- Endocrinology: uncontrolled hyperglycemia
- Ophthalmology: initial evaluation + annual
- Nephrology: deranged renal function
- Cardiology: CAD, heart failure, arrhythmia
