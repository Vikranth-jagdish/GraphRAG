## title: ICMR GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018

## Benefits of exercise

- z Improves insulin sensitivity, reduces the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, bone diseases, and unhealthy weight gain
- z Keeps one flexible and agile
- z Helps relieve stress, anxiety and prevents depression
- z Increases strength and stamina
- z Promotes sound sleep
- z Increases metabolic rate and digestion
- z Lowers lipids
- z Delays the process of aging

Recommendation is about 150 minutes of aerobic activity or its equivalent /week along with some resistance training at least twice a week and flexibility exercises.

People with diabetes need an extra quick acting carbohydrate snack before the exercise and during the exercise, if the exercise period extends the daily-recommended routine.

## 6.4 Yoga and Diabetes

The practice of yoga is a traditional Indian system, which has gained international recognition as a means of developing stress coping skills and is increasingly being suggested as a part of holistic diabetes management. Some of the aspects used in yoga are:

- Asanas (involving postures)
- Pranayama (involving breath)
- Dhyana (involving meditation)

While the details of these techniques are beyond the scope of these Guidelines, there is growing evidence to suggest that yoga may benefit patients with type 2 diabetes. Yogic practices may beneficially impact several aspects of diabetes management, such as glycemic control, lipids, and body fat content. Other suggested benefits include reduction in oxidative stress and blood pressure, improvement of pulmonary and autonomic function, mood, sleep, and quality of life; and reduction in doses of anti-diabetic medication. However, there is an urgent need for additional high-quality studies to confirm the potential benefits of yoga as well as its mechanisms of action in this patient population and some such studies have been initiated.

## SECTION 7 PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES

This section is divided into

1. Oral anti-hyperglycaemic drugs
2. Insulin therapy
3. Non-insulin injectable therapy

## 7.1 Anti-Hyperglycaemic Drugs

Blood glucose levels are determined by several factors such as absorption of glucose from gut, uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues (muscle, adipose tissue), hepatic glucose output, and secretion of hormones such as insulin and glucagon from the pancreas and incretins from the gut, as well as renal handling of glucose. Various anti-hyperglycaemic agents act by modifying the factors aiding in the control of hyperglycaemia as shown in Figure 7.1. The oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents currently available in India are listed in Table 7.1.

In addition, various fixed dose combinations (FDC) are also available although the Drug Controller of India (DCGI) does not favour FDCs particularly those consisting of more than two drugs.

## 7.1.1 Biguanides:

Metformin is the only biguanide available in clinical practice. It mediates its effect by enhancing sensitivity of the liver and peripheral tissues to circulating insulin. The recommended starting daily dose is 500 mg after meals, which may be increased by 500 mg every two weeks until desired therapeutic goals are achieved or maximum daily doses (2500 mg) are reached. It can be used in combination with any other oral or injectable anti-hyperglycaemic agents. Metformin rarely produces hypoglycaemia when used as monotherapy. It is also associated with weight loss and is hence recommended as the first line treatment in type 2 diabetes. Metformin has a favorable effect on lipids by decreasing triglycerides. It is advisable to stop metformin at least 24 hours before elective major surgery or use of radiocontrast media. Metformin should be withdrawn if any contraindications to its use occur.

## (a) Side effects:

- z Gastrointestinal side effects like abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea may occur in some patients. These can be minimized if metformin is administered after meals with slow titration of doses and with the use of sustained release preparations
- z Lactic acidosis is a rare side effect and is very uncommon unless metformin is given in the presence of contraindications, given below
- z Prolonged use of metformin may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency

## (b) Contraindications:

- z Renal insufficiency ( see Box )
- z Hepatic insufficiency
- z Respiratory insufficiency and other hypoxemic conditions
- z Acute myocardial infarction
- z Congestive cardiac failure
- z Alcohol abuse
- z Ketoacidosis
- z Severe infections

## METFORMIN IN RENAL INSUFFICIENCY

The dose of metformin needs adjustment based on the patient's renal function, as assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Metformin can be given in full doses if the eGFR is above 60 ml/min. If the eGFR is between 45 and 60 ml/min, the drug can be continued at full dose with more frequent monitoring of renal function. Below 45 ml/min, the dose should be halved and no patient started anew on metformin; the drug should be stopped if the eGFR drops below 30 ml/min.

## 7.1.2 Sulphonylureas:

The sulphonylureas (glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide and glimepiride) bind to specific sulphonylurea receptors on pancreatic β-cells and increase insulin secretion. Therapy should be initiated with the lowest effective dose and titrated upwards every two weeks until the desired control or maximal dosage is reached. Sulphonylureas are preferably given 15 to 30 minutes before meals. They can be combined with all other anti-hyperglycaemic agents except glinides and other sulphonylureas. Various clinical trials have failed to conclusively demonstrate superiority of one sulphonylurea over the other, when used in optimal doses. In individual cases, switching from one sulphonylurea to another may show some benefit, but this may not be long lasting.

## (a) Factors to be considered when evaluating non-responsiveness to sulphonylureas:

- z Weight gain
- z Non-compliance to diet and exercise
- z Poor compliance to drugs
- z Inadequate dosage
- z Impaired absorption

- z Co-existing endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease
- z Concomitant medications such as steroids
- z Infections, stress

## (b) Side effects:

Hypoglycaemia is the commonest side effect of sulphonylurea therapy. It is more likely to be prolonged and profound with older and long acting sulphonylureas like glibenclamide and hence they should be used with extreme caution in the elderly. The other side effects are:

- z Weight gain
- z Photosensitivity reactions (hyperpigmentation of exposed parts) may occur
- z Rarely, skin rashes, leucopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, cholestatic jaundice, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or granulomatous hepatitis may occur

## (c) Contraindications:

- z Type 1 diabetes
- z Renal insufficiency
- z Hepatic insufficiency, acute hepatitis
- z Ketoacidosis
- z Acute myocardial infarction
- z Extensive infections (e.g. disseminated tuberculosis)
- z History of adverse reactions to sulphonylureas

## 7.1.3 Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (Gliptins):

These agents work by inhibiting the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, which breaks down the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) secreted from the gut in response to a meal. Increase in blood levels of incretin hormones stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas and suppression of glucagon release from the alpha cells. The main advantages of gliptins are that they do not cause hypoglycaemia when used as monotherapy and are weight-neutral. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, teneligliptin and gemigliptin are the DPP-4 inhibitors available in India at present. Most of the gliptins are used as a single daily dose except vildagliptin which is used twice a day. Gliptins are best used in combination with metformin as second line of therapy. They can also be used as monotherapy or in combination with any other oral antihyperglycaemic agent or insulin. The dosage should be reduced in the presence of renal insufficiency except in the case of linagliptin, teneligliptin and gemigliptin (the latter two to be used with caution in advanced renal disease).

## (a) Side effects:

- z Gastrointestinal problems - including nausea, diarrhoea and stomach pain
- z Flu-like symptoms - headache, runny nose, sore throat
- z Skin reactions - painful skin followed by a red or purple rash
- z Joint pains

## (b) Contraindications:

- z Acute pancreatitis
- z Dose of sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin should be reduced in renal impairment, teneligliptin and gemigliptin should be used with caution in advanced renal disease (linagliptin can be continued at unchanged doses)
- z Allergic reactions to gliptins
- z Saxagliptin should be avoided in cardiac failure

## 7.1.4 SGLT2 Inhibitors (Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 inhibitors):

Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are the agents in this class available in India at present. They inhibit SGLT2 located on the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney thus causing glycosuria. In addition to reducing blood glucose levels, these agents also cause weight loss and reduction of blood pressure. There is also some evidence that these agents have cardiovascular benefits over and above their glucose lowering effects.

## (a) Side effects:

- z Genital mycotic infections
- z Urinary tract infections
- z Polyuria
- z Volume depletion in elderly persons
- z Euglycemic ketoacidosis
- z Lower extremity amputations have been reported with canagliflozin

## (b) Contraindications:

- z Recurrent genitourinary infections
- z Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis
- z Type 1 diabetes
- z Hypersensitivity

## 7.1.5. Thiazolidinediones (Glitazones):

Pioglitazone is the only agent in this category available in India at present. It is an insulin sensitizer at adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. This effect is brought about by its binding to nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-y). It also inhibits hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone has partial PPAR-

alpha agonist activity, which accounts for its beneficial effects on lipid profile. The dose of pioglitazone commonly used in clinical practice ranges from 7.5 to 30 mg once a day. The action sets in from 2-4 weeks of starting therapy and the maximum effect is observed after 8-12 weeks. Pioglitazone can be combined with all other antihyperglycaemic agents; however, combination with insulin should be done with caution. Women with anovulatory cycles may ovulate when using pioglitazone; hence, adequate contraceptive advice should be given.

## (a) Side effects:

- z Weight gain may be quite significant and is dose- related
- z Edema and cardiac failure are reported especially when combined with insulin
- z Other adverse events include anaemia and haemodilution
- z Higher risk of fractures especially in post-menopausal women
- z Bladder cancer has been reported on prolonged use

## (b) Contraindications and cautions:

- z Type 1 diabetes
- z History of cardiac failure
- z Pregnancy and lactation
- z Moderate to severe anaemia
- z History of bladder cancer or those with unexplained hematuria; known risk factors for bladder cancer to be assessed before starting pioglitazone
- z Use with caution in elderly and avoid use as first-line agent
- z Review use after 3 to 6 months and withdraw if clinical benefit not seen

## 7.1.6 Non-sulphonylurea Insulin Secretagogues (Glinides):

Repaglinide and nateglinide are non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogues. They are benzoic acid derivatives, which act on separate non-sulphonylurea receptor binding sites on the β-cell and enhance insulin secretion. These agents are absorbed rapidly (0.5-1 hr) and have a short half life (&lt;1 hr). Thus, they result in rapid but brief release of insulin, and hence may be useful in managing postprandial hyperglycaemia. They have to be administered with each meal.

- z They produce fewer and milder hypoglycaemic episodes and other side effects compared to sulphonylureas
- z The indications and contraindications for these agents are similar to sulphonylureas
- z They may be used in mild renal insufficiency and elderly under supervision
- z There is no indication for combining these drugs with sulfonylureas

## 7.1.7 Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors:

Alpha- glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) (acarbose, miglitol and voglibose) act by competitively inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, the enzyme in the small intestine brush border which breaks down oligosaccharides and disaccharides into mono-saccharides. Thus, the absorption of glucose is delayed. AGIs are especially useful in decreasing post-prandial glucose levels. They can be combined with all other oral and injectable anti-hyperglycaemic agents. These agents should be started with the minimum dose at any one meal and then increased to the maximum tolerable dose. They must be ingested with the first bite of food, as the drug must be present in the small bowel with the food for proper effect. Hypoglycaemia rarely occurs if used as monotherapy. If hypoglycaemia results from combination therapy of which AGI is a component, treatment should be with oral glucose rather than sucrose.

(a) Side effects : Gastrointestinal side effects like bloating, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and flatulence are common.

## (b) Contraindications:

- z Inflammatory bowel disease
- z Cirrhosis of liver
- z Malabsorption syndromes
- z Moderate to End Stage Renal Disease

## 7.1.8 Other oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents:

The disease-modifying antirheumatoid drug hydroxychloroquine and the dopamine agonist bromocriptine are also approved for use as antihyperglycaemic agents in India. The role of these agents in the therapeutic algorithm for type 2 diabetes needs further study. The dual PPARα/γ agonist saroglitazar is only licensed for use in diabetic dyslipidaemia in India and not as an antihyperglycaemic agent.

## 7.1.9 General Guidelines for using oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents:

Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease and hence treatment should be individualized. In every case, due emphasis should be given to encouraging healthy lifestyle choices such as increasing physical activity and modification of diet. In some cases, lifestyle changes alone would suffice to attain therapeutic targets. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes will need pharmacotherapy for achieving their glycemic goals.

To help the practitioner in selecting the optimal antihyperglycaemic agent, we present below a table showing the important advantages and the disadvantages of each class of agent ( Figure 7.2 ) and a suggested algorithm for their use ( Figure 7.3) .
